    "According to [the official site](http://jupyter.org/), Project Jupyter is an open source project that allows you to share code in an interactive platform. JupyterLab is the next evolution from earlier Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter now supports many programming languages besides Python 2 and Python 3. See a list [here](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).\n",

    "### installing\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Jupyterlab, read the [documentation here](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io). The Jupyter docs recommend installing Anaconda; however, if you already have Python installed, just install jupyter with pip/pip3 commands. \n",

    "### running\n",
    "\n",
    "At terminal, in the folder of your choice, type **jupyter lab** and the server will start, and then open your default web browser to the local host URL. When you want to exit, save and close any notebooks you have open, close the browser tab, and hit ctrl-c a couple of times in the terminal window to shut down. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you first run you will see the folder contents. You can click on a notebook to open it or also do other things like rename or delete it. To create a new notebook, use the *File->New* menu.\n",

    "### things to notice\n",
    "\n",
    "* the cells can be of different types: **markdown** for text cells and **code** for code\n",
    "* the toolbar lets you do the usual things like cut, copy, paste, as well as the up/down arrows to move cells, and the play/stop icons to run code or stop it\n",
    "* there is also a menu at the top with self-explanatory labels\n",

To learn more about Markdown, click **Help** above, then **Markdown**.\n",
