Ransomware usually infects a computer when a user opens a phishing email and, although such emails have been alleged to be used to infect machines with WannaCry, this method of attack has not been confirmed. Once installed, WannaCry uses the EternalBlue exploit and DoublePulsar backdoor developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) to spread through local networks and remote hosts, that have not been updated with the most recent security updates, to directly infect any exposed systems. A "critical" patch had been issued by Microsoft on 14 March 2017 to remove the underlying vulnerability for supported systems, nearly two months before the attack, but many organizations had not yet applied it.
Those still running exposed older, unsupported operating systems such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, were initially at particular risk but Microsoft has now taken the unusual step of releasing updates for these operating systems for all customers.
