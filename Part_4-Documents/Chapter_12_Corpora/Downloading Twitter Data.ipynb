    "# Downloading Twitter Data\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* This notebook was created back when Twitter was .... Twitter. New ownership has dismantled free programmatic access (among other things). This notebook remains available in the hope that things improve. This link [from George Mason University](https://infoguides.gmu.edu/social-media/twitter) provides some guidance for getting Twitter/X data, which unfortunately is no longer free. There are Twitter data sets that members of the machine learning and NLP communities have made available which can be found with patient Google searches. \n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter --provides-- rather, used to provide a package for downloading tweets that can be installed with pip or pip3:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install tweepy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting started with the code below, you need a Twitter account, and then you need to get a Twitter Developer Account. This was the sign up link: https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access.html\n",
    "\n",
    "A personal account with standard access was all that was needed. You can always upgrade later.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have developer access, you will be taken to a documentation page to help you get started. To get the authentication keys you need to create an app. You will need to have a web page set up for the app. The guidelines walk you through it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the app is set up you can get keys and put them in the code as outlined below.\n"
