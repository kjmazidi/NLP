1	2.26666666667	The Rock is destined to be the 21st Century's new ''Conan'' and that he's going to make a splash even greater than Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jean Claud Van Damme or Steven Segal.
2	3.53333333333	The gorgeously elaborate continuation of ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy is so huge that a column of words cannot adequately describe co writer/director Peter Jackson's expanded vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle earth.
3	-0.6	Effective but too tepid biopic
4	1.46666666667	If you sometimes like to go to the movies to have fun, Wasabi is a good place to start.
5	1.73333333333	Emerges as something rare, an issue movie that's so honest and keenly observed that it doesn't feel like one.
6	2.53333333333	The film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics    even those who have reached the absolute top of the game.
7	2.46666666667	Offers that rare combination of entertainment and education.
8	1.26666666667	Perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
9	1.93333333333	Steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges; it's so clever you want to hate it. But he somehow pulls it off.
10	1.73333333333	Take Care of My Cat offers a refreshingly different slice of Asian cinema.
11	2.06666666667	This is a film well worth seeing, talking and singing heads and all.
12	1.66666666667	What really surprises about Wisegirls is its low key quality and genuine tenderness.
13	3.13333333333	(Wendigo is) why we go to the cinema: to be fed through the eye, the heart, the mind.
14	3.66666666667	One of the greatest family oriented, fantasy adventure movies ever.
15	1.33333333333	Ultimately, it ponders the reasons we need stories so much.
16	2.2	An utterly compelling 'who wrote it' in which the reputation of the most famous author who ever lived comes into question.
17	1.0	Illuminating if overly talky documentary.
18	3.4	A masterpiece four years in the making.
19	2.2	The movie's ripe, enrapturing beauty will tempt those willing to probe its inscrutable mysteries.
20	2.53333333333	Offers a breath of the fresh air of true sophistication.
21	2.8	A thoughtful, provocative, insistently humanizing film.
22	2.46666666667	With a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film, Lovely &amp; Amazing involves us because it is so incisive, so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives.
23	2.0	A disturbing and frighteningly evocative assembly of imagery and hypnotic music composed by Philip Glass.
24	1.13333333333	Not for everyone, but for those with whom it will connect, it's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare.
25	1.2	Scores a few points for doing what it does with a dedicated and good hearted professionalism.
26	1.26666666667	Occasionally melodramatic, it's also extremely effective.
27	1.53333333333	An idealistic love story that brings out the latent 15 year old romantic in everyone.
28	-0.333333333333	At about 95 minutes, Treasure Planet maintains a brisk pace as it races through the familiar story. However, it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with Stevenson's tale as well as with earlier Disney efforts.
29	0.866666666667	It helps that Lil Bow Wow ... tones down his pint sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid.
30	2.2	Guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook, rattled, or rolled.
31	2.8	A masterful film from a master filmmaker, unique in its deceptive grimness, compelling in its fatalist worldview.
32	0.466666666667	Light, cute and forgettable.
33	1.4	If there's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs, I think it's in projects like the (unfortunately R rated) Paid.
34	1.73333333333	While it would be easy to give Crush the new title of Two Weddings and a Funeral, it's a far more thoughtful film than any slice of Hugh Grant whimsy.
35	-0.6	Though everything might be literate and smart, it never took off and always seemed static.
36	1.86666666667	Cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies, two lane highways, and roadside cafes that permeate Vincent's days
37	1.2	Ms. Fulford Wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky, calculating Lolita turn.
38	1.86666666667	Though it is by no means his best work, Laissez Passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona fide master, a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them.
39	-0.666666666667	Like most Bond outings in recent years, some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike. A heavy reliance on CGI technology is beginning to creep into the series.
40	1.86666666667	Newton draws our attention like a magnet, and acts circles around her better known co star, Mark Wahlberg.
41	0.933333333333	The story loses its bite in a last minute happy ending that's even less plausible than the rest of the picture. Much of the way, though, this is a refreshingly novel ride.
42	2.06666666667	Fuller would surely have called this gutsy and at times exhilarating movie a great yarn.
43	1.46666666667	The film makes a strong case for the importance of the musicians in creating the Motown sound.
44	1.2	Karmen moves like rhythm itself, her lips chanting to the beat, her long, braided hair doing little to wipe away the jeweled beads of sweat.
45	2.46666666667	Gosling provides an amazing performance that dwarfs everything else in the film.
46	1.6	A real movie, about real people, that gives us a rare glimpse into a culture most of us don't know.
47	1.93333333333	Tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable.
48	1.46666666667	May be spoofing an easy target    those old '50's giant creature features    but ... it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today.
49	1.6	An engaging overview of Johnson's eccentric career.
50	0.533333333333	In its ragged, cheap and unassuming way, the movie works.
51	2.0	Some actors have so much charisma that you'd be happy to listen to them reading the phone book. Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock are two such likeable actors.
52	2.13333333333	Sandra Nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly, neurotic, and self absorbed Martha as her heart begins to open.
53	1.8	Behind the snow games and lovable Siberian huskies (plus one sheep dog), the picture hosts a parka wrapped dose of heart.
54	2.0	Everytime you think Undercover Brother has run out of steam, it finds a new way to surprise and amuse.
55	1.06666666667	Manages to be original, even though it rips off many of its ideas.
56	1.06666666667	Singer/composer Bryan Adams contributes a slew of songs    a few potential hits, a few more simply intrusive to the story    but the whole package certainly captures the intended, er, spirit of the piece.
57	1.4	You'd think by now America would have had enough of plucky British eccentrics with hearts of gold. Yet the act is still charming here.
58	1.8	Whether or not you're enlightened by any of Derrida's lectures on ''the other'' and ''the self,'' Derrida is an undeniably fascinating and playful fellow.
59	1.66666666667	A pleasant enough movie, held together by skilled ensemble actors.
60	3.33333333333	This is the best American movie about troubled teens since 1998's Whatever.
61	0.125	Disney has always been hit or miss when bringing beloved kids' books to the screen...Tuck Everlasting is a little of both.
62	2.3125	Just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing.
63	1.375	The animated subplot keenly depicts the inner struggles of our adolescent heroes   insecure, uncontrolled, and intense.
64	1.25	The invincible Werner Herzog is alive and well and living in LA
65	-0.25	Morton is a great actress portraying a complex character, but Morvern Callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start.
66	1.625	Part of the charm of Satin Rouge is that it avoids the obvious with humour and lightness.
67	0.9375	Son of the Bride may be a good half hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness.
68	1.25	A simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them.
69	2.0625	A taut, intelligent psychological drama.
70	2.8125	A truly moving experience, and a perfect example of how art    when done right    can help heal, clarify, and comfort.
71	3.0625	This delicately observed story, deeply felt and masterfully stylized, is a triumph for its maverick director.
72	1.0625	At heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance.
73	2.875	The appearance of Treebeard and Gollum's expanded role will either have you loving what you're seeing, or rolling your eyes. I loved it! Gollum's 'performance' is incredible!
74	2.0	a screenplay more ingeniously constructed than ''Memento''
75	3.0625	If this movie were a book, it would be a page turner, you can't wait to see what happens next.
76	0.9375	Haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration.
77	0.0	Absorbing and disturbing    perhaps more disturbing than originally intended    but a little clarity would have gone a long way.
78	3.5625	It's the best film of the year so far, the benchmark against which all other Best Picture contenders should be measured.
79	2.0	Painful to watch, but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year's most accomplished and riveting film performances.
80	1.5625	This is a startling film that gives you a fascinating, albeit depressing view of Iranian rural life close to the Iraqi border.
81	1.5625	A few artsy flourishes aside, Narc is as gritty as a movie gets these days.
82	1.125	While The Isle is both preposterous and thoroughly misogynistic, its vistas are incredibly beautiful to look at.
83	2.125	Together, Tok and O orchestrate a buoyant, darkly funny dance of death. In the process, they demonstrate that there's still a lot of life in Hong Kong cinema.
84	1.75	Director Kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure, and this is a better film than his earlier English language movie, the overpraised Elizabeth.
85	2.4375	The movie is a blast of educational energy, as bouncy animation and catchy songs escort you through the entire 85 minutes.
86	2.4375	A sports movie with action that's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it.
87	1.8125	Doug Liman, the director of Bourne, directs the traffic well, gets a nice wintry look from his locations, absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses Damon's ability to be focused and sincere.
88	1.625	The tenderness of the piece is still intact.
89	2.25	Katz uses archival footage, horrifying documents of lynchings, still photographs and charming old reel to reel recordings of Meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history, but most powerful of all is the song itself
90	1.8125	Like the film's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early '80s suburbia, it's significant without being overstated.
91	-0.176470588235	While McFarlane's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming of age films ... it's also so jarring that it's hard to get back into the boys' story.
92	0.705882352941	If nothing else, this movie introduces a promising, unusual kind of psychological horror.
93	0.705882352941	In a normal screen process, these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the Discovery Channel. But in Imax 3 D, the clichés disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography.
94	1.52941176471	Writer director Burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear.
95	1.29411764706	...a roller coaster ride of a movie
96	0.235294117647	I enjoyed Time of Favor while I was watching it, but I was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory.
97	2.17647058824	Chicago is sophisticated, brash, sardonic, completely joyful in its execution.
98	1.29411764706	Steve Irwin's method is Ernest Hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume.
99	1.70588235294	A refreshing Korean film about five female high school friends who face an uphill battle when they try to take their relationships into deeper waters.
100	0.588235294118	On the surface, it's a lovers on the run crime flick, but it has a lot in common with Piesiewicz's and Kieslowski's earlier work, films like The Double Life of Veronique.
101	1.35294117647	The values that have held the Enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again courage, self sacrifice and patience under pressure.
102	2.0	If it's possible for a sequel to outshine the original, then SL2 does just that.

104	0.470588235294	4 friends, 2 couples, 2000 miles, and all the Pabst Blue Ribbon beer they can drink   it's the ultimate redneck road trip.
105	1.41176470588	The film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today's cinema du sarcasm
106	1.47058823529	It might be tempting to regard Mr. Andrew and his collaborators as oddballs, but Mr. Earnhart's quizzical, charming movie allows us to see them, finally, as artists.
107	2.11764705882	A feel good picture in the best sense of the term.
108	1.94117647059	Edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects, Pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head, making it rousing, invigorating fun lacking any MTV puffery.
109	1.82352941176	A mostly intelligent, engrossing and psychologically resonant suspenser.
110	0.941176470588	It's this memory as identity obviation that gives Secret Life its intermittent unease, reaffirming that long held illusions are indeed reality, and that erasing them recasts the self.
111	0.588235294118	Hip hop has a history, and it's a metaphor for this love story.
112	1.88235294118	In scope, ambition and accomplishment, Children of the Century ... takes Kurys' career to a whole new level.
113	1.41176470588	This may not have the dramatic gut wrenching impact of other Holocaust films, but it's a compelling story, mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there.
114	1.47058823529	Between the drama of Cube?s personal revelations regarding what the shop means in the big picture, iconic characters gambol fluidly through the story, with charming results.
115	1.64705882353	A gentle, compassionate drama about grief and healing.
116	0.294117647059	Somewhere short of Tremors on the modern B scene: neither as funny nor as clever, though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes.
117	1.52941176471	Digital video documentary about stand up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world.
118	1.35294117647	Unlike most teen flicks, Swimming takes its time to tell its story, casts mostly little known performers in key roles, and introduces some intriguing ambiguity.
119	1.76470588235	An enthralling, playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the 'truth' about this man, while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that Derrida would doubtless give his blessing to.
120	2.58823529412	''Extreme Ops'' exceeds expectations. Good fun, good action, good acting, good dialogue, good pace, good cinematography.
121	1.70588235294	You Should Pay Nine Bucks for This: Because you can hear about suffering Afghan refugees on the news and still be unaffected. Dramas like this make it human.
122	1.70588235294	A thunderous ride at first, quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action. Still, this flick is fun, and host to some truly excellent sequences.
123	1.88235294118	It's obviously struck a responsive chord with many South Koreans, and should work its magic in other parts of the world.
124	2.29411764706	Run, don't walk, to see this barbed and bracing comedy on the big screen.
125	2.0	A classy item by a legend who may have nothing left to prove but still has the chops and drive to show how its done.
126	0.941176470588	It is nature against progress. In Fessenden's horror trilogy, this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale.
127	1.0	It's not exactly a gourmet meal but the fare is fair, even coming from the drive thru.
128	2.35294117647	This is what IMAX was made for: Strap on a pair of 3 D goggles, shut out the real world, and take a vicarious voyage to the last frontier    space.
129	2.41176470588	Merely as a technical, logistical feat, Russian Ark marks a cinematic milestone.
130	2.29411764706	(Schweiger is) talented and terribly charismatic, qualities essential to both movie stars and social anarchists.
131	1.29411764706	It's a great deal of sizzle and very little steak. But what spectacular sizzle it is!...In this incarnation its fizz is infectious.
132	2.11764705882	An original gem about an obsession with time.
133	1.88235294118	It will delight newcomers to the story and those who know it from bygone days.
134	2.17647058824	Gloriously goofy (and gory) midnight movie stuff.
135	1.88235294118	The film overcomes the regular minefield of coming of age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity.
136	1.29411764706	If your senses haven't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests, if you're a connoisseur of psychological horror, this is your ticket.
137	0.882352941176	It's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness, while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene.
138	1.35294117647	It is intensely personal and yet    unlike Quills    deftly shows us the temper of the times.
139	1.52941176471	As lo fi as the special effects are, the folks who cobbled Nemesis together indulge the force of humanity over hardware in a way that George Lucas has long forgotten.
140	0.823529411765	Like Mike doesn't win any points for originality. It does succeed by following a feel good formula with a winning style, and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism.
141	1.70588235294	It's a hoot and a half, and a great way for the American people to see what a candidate is like when he's not giving the same 15 cent stump speech.
142	1.41176470588	Far from perfect, but its heart is in the right place...innocent and well meaning.
143	1.35294117647	A sad, superior human comedy played out on the back roads of life.
144	1.58823529412	Waydowntown is by no means a perfect film, but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality.
145	2.35294117647	Tim Allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast, as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy.
146	1.52941176471	More a load of enjoyable, Conan esque claptrap than the punishing, special effects soul assaults the Mummy pictures represent.
147	1.88235294118	Enormously likable, partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd.
148	1.82352941176	Here's a British flick gleefully unconcerned with plausibility, yet just as determined to entertain you.
149	2.0	It's an old story, but a lively script, sharp acting and partially animated interludes make Just a Kiss seem minty fresh.
150	1.88235294118	Must be seen to be believed.
151	-0.333333333333	Ray Liotta and Jason Patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles, but don't be fooled: Nobody deserves any prizes here.
152	1.5	Everything that has to do with Yvan and Charlotte, and everything that has to do with Yvan's rambunctious, Jewish sister and her non Jew husband, feels funny and true.
153	2.38888888889	The year's happiest surprise, a movie that deals with a real subject in an always surprising way.
154	1.77777777778	Fans of Behan's work and of Irish movies in general will be rewarded by Borstal Boy.
155	1.38888888889	Its mysteries are transparently obvious, and it's too slowly paced to be a thriller. (But it's) worth recommending because of two marvelous performances by Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser.
156	1.38888888889	The film is faithful to what one presumes are the book's twin premises    that we become who we are on the backs of our parents, but we have no idea who they were at our age; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are.
157	1.16666666667	Stephen Earnhart's homespun documentary Mule Skinner Blues has nothing but love for its posse of trailer park denizens.
158	1.61111111111	A solidly seaworthy chiller.
159	2.0	If you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of ''The Isle'' you'll get a sock you in the eye flick that is a visual tour de force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else.
160	1.11111111111	There are as many misses as hits, but ultimately, it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior, and it's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises.
161	1.88888888889	A well made thriller with a certain level of intelligence and non reactionary morality.
162	2.22222222222	There's enough science to make it count as educational, and enough beauty to make it unforgettable.
163	1.22222222222	Remains a solid, if somewhat heavy handed, account of the near disaster...done up by Howard with a steady, if not very imaginative, hand.
164	1.22222222222	Makmalbaf follows a resolutely realistic path in this uncompromising insight into the harsh existence of the Kurdish refugees of Iran's borderlands.
165	1.55555555556	For a good chunk of its running time, Trapped is an effective and claustrophobic thriller.
166	1.55555555556	Most of Crush is a clever and captivating romantic comedy with a welcome pinch of tartness.
167	1.5	Nair does capture the complexity of a big family and its trials and tribulations...
168	1.11111111111	The seaside splendor and shallow, beautiful people are nice to look at while you wait for the story to get going.
169	1.72222222222	Rare is the 'urban comedy' that even attempts the insight and honesty of this disarming indie.
170	2.77777777778	Ranks among Willams' best screen work.
171	1.83333333333	Engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship.
172	2.27777777778	An experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment.
173	1.83333333333	It's traditional moviemaking all the way, but it's done with a lot of careful period attention as well as some very welcome wit.
174	0.833333333333	Maybe it's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades ... But honestly, Analyze That really isn't all that bad.
175	1.66666666667	A droll, well acted, character driven comedy with unexpected deposits of feeling.
176	3.05555555556	This is simply the most fun you'll ever have with a documentary!
177	2.66666666667	A very funny movie.
178	1.5	Watching Haneke's film is, aptly enough, a challenge and a punishment. But watching Huppert, a great actress tearing into a landmark role, is riveting.

180	1.44444444444	Britney has been delivered to the big screen safe and sound, the way we like our 20 year old superstar girls to travel on the fame freeway.

182	0.0	The kind of nervous film that will either give you a mild headache or exhilarate you.
183	0.941176470588	Watching Beanie and his gang put together his slasher video from spare parts and borrowed materials is as much fun as it must have been for them to make it.
184	2.11764705882	Children may not understand everything that happens    I'm not sure even Miyazaki himself does    but they will almost certainly be fascinated, and undoubtedly delighted.
185	2.64705882353	A fascinating and fun film.
186	2.23529411765	Tadpole is a sophisticated, funny and good natured treat, slight but a pleasure.
187	2.41176470588	This insightful, Oscar nominated documentary, in which children on both sides of the ever escalating conflict have their say away from watchful parental eyes, gives peace yet another chance.
188	2.76470588235	I admired this work a lot.
189	1.11764705882	Whether you're moved and love it, or bored or frustrated by the film, you'll still feel something.
190	2.11764705882	...there are enough moments of heartbreaking honesty to keep one glued to the screen.
191	1.82352941176	My goodness, Queen Latifah has a lot to offer and she seemed to have no problem flaunting her natural gifts. She must have a very strong back.

199	1.0	A somewhat crudely constructed but gripping, questing look at a person so racked with self loathing, he becomes an enemy to his own race.
200	0.588235294118	It extends the writings of Jean Genet and John Rechy, the films of Fassbinder, perhaps even the nocturnal works of Goya.
201	1.41176470588	Narc may not get an 'A' for originality, but it wears its B movie heritage like a badge of honor.
202	1.29411764706	With the film's striking ending, one realizes that we have a long way to go before we fully understand all the sexual permutations involved.
203	1.58823529412	(Drumline) is entertaining for what it does, and admirable for what it doesn't do.
204	1.35294117647	At its best early on as it plays the culture clashes between the brothers.

210	2.05882352941	Now trimmed by about 20 minutes, this lavish three year old production has enough grandeur and scale to satisfy as grown up escapism.
211	1.25	We get some truly unique character studies and a cross section of Americana that Hollywood couldn't possibly fictionalize and be believed.
212	0.8125	Though this film can be clumsy, its ambitions are equally    and admirably    uncommercial.
213	2.6875	Daring, mesmerizing and exceedingly hard to forget.
214	2.375	Moore's performance impresses almost as much as her work with Haynes in 1995's Safe.

217	2.4375	Mr. Parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence, composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor, or an absurdist workplace sitcom.
218	2.5	The result is something quite fresh and delightful.
219	2.0	All but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure.
220	1.375	Despite its many infuriating flaws    not the least of which is Amy's self absorbed personality    Amy's O's honesty will win you over.
221	3.0	This is one of Polanski's best films.
222	1.625	Day is not a great Bond movie, but it is a good Bond movie, which still makes it much better than your typical Bond knock offs.
223	0.875	Polished Korean political action film is just as good    and bad    as Hollywood action epics. Is this progress?

233	2.9375	Jirí Hubac's script is a gem. His characters are engaging, intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving. The scope of the Silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives, full of strength, warmth and vitality..
234	2.3125	Moore's complex and important film is also, believe it or not, immensely entertaining, a David and Goliath story that's still very much playing itself out.
235	1.8125	The additional storyline is interesting and entertaining, but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story. I like the new footage and still love the old stuff.
236	1.625	Though Mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third act plot development is somewhat melodramatic, its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a Jules and Jim for the new millennium.

243	3.52	One of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade.

245	1.56	Benefits from a strong performance from Zhao, but it's Dong Jie's face you remember at the end.
246	2.52	This is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever.
247	2.04	The director, Steven Shainberg, has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters, making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun.
248	2.2	It ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of Latin America's most oppressive regimes.

255	2.12	Has it ever been possible to say that Williams has truly inhabited a character? It is now.
256	1.52	By presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world, Pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible    which forces us to confront what's possible and what we might do to make it so.
257	2.32	An impressive debut for first time writer director Mark Romanek, especially considering his background is in music video.
258	2.28	An incendiary, deeply thought provoking look at one of the most peculiar (and peculiarly venomous) bigotries in our increasingly frightening theocracy
259	2.28	All the performances are top notch and, once you get through the accents, All or Nothing becomes an emotional, though still positive, wrench of a sit.
260	0.72	''its successes are also tempered with elements which prove the direct antithesis of what it gets right.''
261	2.16	It's solid and affecting and exactly as thought provoking as it should be.
262	3.44	This is such a dazzlingly self assured directorial debut that it's hard to know what to praise first.
263	2.04	Parker holds true to Wilde's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning, and no desire to be anything but a polished, sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness.
264	1.36	Münch's genuine insight makes the film's occasional overindulgence forgivable.
265	1.24	Thankfully, the film, which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality ... takes a tongue in cheek attitude even as it pushes the Croc Hunter agenda.
266	-0.04	Ultimately, the message of Trouble Every Day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life's stasis.
267	2.32	If you're like me, a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat, then Mostly Martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite.
268	2.44	The film has just enough of everything    re enactments, archival footage, talking head interviews    and the music is simply sublime.

281	1.70588235294	...if you're in a mind set for goofy comedy, the troopers will entertain with their gross outs, bawdy comedy and head games.
282	1.52941176471	Somewhat blurred, but Kinnear's performance is razor sharp.
283	1.0	As a director, Mr. Ratliff wisely rejects the temptation to make fun of his subjects.
284	1.64705882353	For anyone who remembers the '60s or is interested in one man's response to stroke, Ram Dass: Fierce Grace is worth seeking out.
285	1.11764705882	Intriguing and beautiful film, but those of you who read the book are likely to be disappointed.

296	1.64705882353	Nearly surreal, dabbling in French, this is no simple movie, and you'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it. I enjoyed the ride (bumps and all), creamy depth, and ultimate theme.

303	1.42857142857	It's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality, and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world.
304	2.0	Spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects. He just wants them to be part of the action, the wallpaper of his chosen reality. Here, thankfully, they are.

326	1.47619047619	The diversity of the artists represented, both in terms of style and ethnicity, prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious, as does the appropriately brief 40 minute running time.
327	2.33333333333	The Pianist is a fine valedictory work for Polanski, made richer by his own experiences, making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain.

331	1.93333333333	Farrell ... thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to Willis's world weary colonel.

336	2.86666666667	A model of what films like this should be like.
337	2.0	As Weber and Weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve, the Cockettes weren't as much about gender, sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel, connect and create.

339	2.73333333333	An unbelievably fun film just a leading man away from perfection.
340	2.4	Over the top and a bit ostentatious, this is a movie that's got oodles of style and substance.

342	1.8	Nicely serves as an examination of a society in transition.
343	2.0	A tender and touching drama, based on the true story of a troubled African American's quest to come to terms with his origins, reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle.

1221	1.29411764706	My thoughts were focused on the characters. That is a compliment to Kuras and Miller. If I had been thinking about the visual medium, they would have been doing something wrong.

1237	1.11111111111	It's unnerving to see Recoing's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment. Good film, but very glum.

1263	2.77272727273	It's so good that you can practically see the Hollywood 'suits' trying to put together the cast and filmmaking team for the all too  inevitable American remake.
1264	2.45454545455	The weight of the piece, the unerring professionalism of the chilly production, and the fascination embedded in the lurid topic prove recommendation enough.

1276	2.90909090909	Audrey Tatou has a knack for picking roles that magnify her outrageous charm, and in this literate French comedy, she's as morning glory exuberant as she was in Amélie.
1277	2.45454545455	The movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate/surf culture, the L.A. beach scene and the imaginative (and sometimes illegal) ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults.

1350	0.5	The primitive force of this film seems to bubble up from the vast collective memory of the combatants. It's like watching a nightmare made flesh.
1351	1.0	It is the sheer, selfish, wound licking, bar scrapping doggedness of Leon's struggle to face and transmute his demons that makes the movie a spirited and touching occasion, despite its patchy construction.
1352	2.8	A gorgeous, high spirited musical from India that exquisitely blends music, dance, song, and high drama.

1362	1.53333333333	There's really only one good idea in this movie, but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache.
1363	1.86666666667	A simple, but gritty and well acted ensemble drama that encompasses a potent metaphor for a country still dealing with its fascist past.
1364	2.2	Lovely and poignant. Puts a human face on a land most Westerners are unfamiliar with.
1365	0.866666666667	I can't say that I liked Homeboy; it'd be more accurate to say that I found it intriguing, bizarre, Dogma like in spots   and quite truthful, in its way.
1366	2.0	Displaying about equal amounts of naiveté, passion and talent, Beneath Clouds establishes Sen as a filmmaker of considerable potential.
1367	1.6	The vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high, even as the strafings blend together.

1369	0.933333333333	We learn a lot about dying coral and see a lot of life on the reef.
1370	1.13333333333	If the first Men in Black was money, the second is small change. But it still jingles in the pocket. It's fun lite.

1374	2.66666666667	Just as moving, uplifting and funny as ever.

1386	0.533333333333	Corny, schmaltzy and predictable, but still manages to be kind of heartwarming, nonetheless. It's the perfect kind of film to see when you don't want to use your brain. At all.
1387	1.46666666667	While it regards 1967 as the key turning point of the 20th century, and returns again and again to images of dissidents in the streets, it's alarmingly current.

1391	1.06666666667	Stephen Rea, Aidan Quinn, and Alan Bates play Desmond's legal eagles, and when joined by Brosnan, the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty Irish settings is a pleasant enough thing, 'tis.

1397	1.93333333333	Trademark American triteness and simplicity are tossed out the window with the intelligent French drama that deftly explores the difficult relationship between a father and son.
1398	2.06666666667	One from the heart.
1399	1.86666666667	More concerned with Sade's ideas than with his actions. The movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as... (Quills) did by showing them.
1400	2.66666666667	An entertaining, colorful, action filled crime story with an intimate heart.
1401	1.46666666667	While Undisputed isn't exactly a high, it is a gripping, tidy little movie that takes Mr. Hill higher than he's been in a while.

1414	2.23529411765	Very psychoanalytical    provocatively so    and also refreshingly literary.
1415	3.0	A gorgeous, witty, seductive movie.
1416	2.11764705882	The special effects and many scenes of weightlessness look as good or better than in the original, while the Oscar winning sound and James Horner's rousing score make good use of the hefty audio system.
1417	0.941176470588	On the heels of The Ring comes a similarly morose and humorless horror movie that, although flawed, is to be commended for its straight ahead approach to creepiness.
1418	1.17647058824	With Rabbit Proof Fence, Noyce has tailored an epic tale into a lean, economical movie.

1423	2.58823529412	More romantic, more emotional and ultimately more satisfying than the teary eyed original.
1424	1.52941176471	An appealingly juvenile trifle that delivers its share of laughs and smiles.
1425	2.11764705882	Writer director's Mehta's effort has tons of charm and the whimsy is in the mixture, the intoxicating masala, of cultures and film genres.
1426	1.94117647059	The draw (for ''Big Bad Love'') is a solid performance by Arliss Howard.
1427	1.82352941176	It gets onto the screen just about as much of the novella as one could reasonably expect, and is engrossing and moving in its own right.
1428	3.52941176471	The terrific and bewilderingly underrated Campbell Scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing.
1429	1.58823529412	Cool? This movie is a snow emergency.
1430	1.41176470588	Like Mike isn't interested in recycling old cliches. It wants to tweak them with a taste of tangy new humor.
1431	1.47058823529	Smith is careful not to make fun of these curious owners of architectural oddities. Instead, he shows them the respect they are due.
1432	1.17647058824	A mess when it comes to the characters and writing...but works its way underneath the skin like few movies have in recent memory.

1440	1.23529411765	Kept aloft largely by a comically adept ensemble.
1441	1.52	The sort of film that makes me miss Hitchcock, but also feel optimistic that there's hope for popular cinema yet.
1442	2.24	First time writer director Serry shows a remarkable gift for storytelling with this moving, effective little film.
1443	2.24	It cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears, to be a girl in a world of boys, to be a boy truly in love with a girl, and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life    wherever it takes you.

1447	0.8	The whole is quite entertaining, but despite its virtues, there is an unsettled feeling to the film.
1448	1.8	While its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer's appetite, the film's final scene is soaringly, transparently moving.
1449	1.24	Hardly a masterpiece, but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people.
1450	2.32	Based on a devilishly witty script by Heather McGowan and Niels Mueller, the film gets great laughs, but never at the expense of its characters
1451	1.2	It's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced    but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build up, a terrific climax, and some nice chills along the way.
1452	0.32	If you've ever wondered what an ending without the input of studio executives or test audiences would look like, here it is.
1453	2.28	Exciting and direct, with ghost imagery that shows just enough to keep us on our toes.
1454	2.28	Whether writer director Anne Fontaine's film is a ghost story, an account of a nervous breakdown, a trip down memory lane, all three or none of the above, it is as seductive as it is haunting.
1455	1.2	What the film lacks in general focus it makes up for in compassion, as Corcuera manages to find the seeds of hope in the form of collective action.

1486	2.66666666667	It's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman.
1487	2.42857142857	A moody, multi dimensional love story and sci fi mystery, Solaris is a thought provoking, haunting film that allows the seeds of the imagination to germinate.

1491	1.47619047619	Oscar Wilde's masterpiece, The Importance of Being Earnest, may be the best play of the 19th century. It's so good that its relentless, polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions, but even Oliver Parker's movie adaptation.

1494	1.47619047619	This remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise: Al Pacino loathing Robin Williams.

1498	1.28571428571	Light years/ several warp speeds/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful Insurrection. Which isn't to say that it's the equal of some of its predecessors.
1499	1.80952380952	If this story must be told and retold    and indeed it must    then The Grey Zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle.
1500	2.85714285714	The Lion King was a roaring success when it was released eight years ago, but on Imax it seems better, not just bigger.

1506	1.88888888889	About a manga like heroine who fights back at her abusers, it's energetic and satisfying if not deep and psychological.
1507	2.94444444444	This is human comedy at its most amusing, interesting and confirming.

1511	1.22222222222	The minor figures surrounding (Bobby) ... form a gritty urban mosaic.
1512	1.94444444444	This is wild surreal stuff, but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other.
1513	1.38888888889	It's a demented kitsch mess (although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative), but it's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year.
1514	0.944444444444	There is nothing outstanding about this film, but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine.
1515	1.66666666667	All in all, the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us, but not necessarily with us.
1516	1.72222222222	An interesting story with a pertinent (cinematically unique) message, told fairly well and scored to perfection, I found myself struggling to put my finger on that elusive ''missing thing.''

1518	2.16666666667	A welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic, this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story.
1519	2.11111111111	A crisp psychological drama (and) a fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old ''Twilight Zone'' episode.
1520	1.83333333333	It has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing.
1521	0.611111111111	Opening with some contrived banter, cliches and some loose ends, the screenplay only comes into its own in the second half.
1522	2.27777777778	An uncluttered, resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations.
1523	1.22222222222	'(The Cockettes) provides a window into a subculture hell bent on expressing itself in every way imaginable.'
1524	2.22222222222	A smart, steamy mix of road movie, coming of age story and political satire.
1525	0.944444444444	The modern day royals have nothing on these guys when it comes to scandals. It's only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after.

1531	0.4375	Shamelessly resorting to pee related sight gags that might even cause Tom Green a grimace; still, Myer's energy and the silliness of it all eventually prevail

1541	1.25	With three excellent principal singers, a youthful and good looking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations, it's enough to make you wish Jacquot had left well enough alone and just filmed the opera without all these distortions of perspective.

1550	2.3125	A good film with a solid pedigree both in front of and, more specifically, behind the camera.
1551	1.5	By no means a slam dunk and sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act, it still comes off as a touching, transcendent love story.

1556	1.9375	It celebrates the group's playful spark of nonconformity, glancing vividly back at what Hibiscus grandly called his 'angels of light.'
1557	2.3125	The story ... is inspiring, ironic, and revelatory of just how ridiculous and money oriented the record industry really is. It is also a testament to the integrity and vision of the band.
1558	2.625	Laced with liberal doses of dark humor, gorgeous exterior photography, and a stable full of solid performances, No Such Thing is a fascinating little tale.
1559	2.3125	Huppert's show to steal and she makes a meal of it, channeling Kathy Baker's creepy turn as the repressed mother on Boston Public just as much as 8 Women's Augustine.

1564	2.0	Familiar but utterly delightful.
1565	2.52941176471	A fascinating, dark thriller that keeps you hooked on the delicious pulpiness of its lurid fiction.
1566	2.41176470588	The film aims to be funny, uplifting and moving, sometimes all at once. The extent to which it succeeds is impressive.
1567	2.76470588235	The film brilliantly shines on all the characters, as the direction is intelligently accomplished.
1568	1.47058823529	While not for every taste, this often very funny collegiate gross out comedy goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the National Lampoon film franchise, too long reduced to direct to video irrelevancy.
1569	1.35294117647	As broad and cartoonish as the screenplay is, there is an accuracy of observation in the work of the director, Frank Novak, that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism.
1570	2.23529411765	In addition to Hoffman's powerful acting clinic, this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt, or will feel someday.
1571	3.0	Jeffrey Tambor's performance as the intelligent jazz playing exterminator is Oscar worthy.
1572	2.11764705882	From the opening strains of the Average White Band's ''Pick up the Pieces'', you can feel the love.

1579	1.0	imagine a scenario where Bergman approaches Swedish fatalism using Gary Larson's Far Side humor
1580	1.23529411765	Too damn weird to pass up, and for the blacklight crowd, way cheaper (and better) than Pink Floyd tickets.
1581	2.0	It is most remarkable not because of its epic scope, but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth.
1582	0.882352941176	It's not a great monster movie. But if you've paid a matinee price and bought a big tub of popcorn, there's guilty fun to be had here. Chomp chomp!
1583	-0.352941176471	The Grey Zone gives voice to a story that needs to be heard in the sea of Holocaust movies...but the film suffers from its own difficulties.

1588	2.41176470588	Writer/director Alexander Payne (Election)and his co writer Jim Taylor brilliantly employ their quirky and fearless ability to look American angst in the eye and end up laughing.
1589	1.58823529412	A movie that at its best doesn't just make the most out of its characters' flaws but insists on the virtue of imperfection.
1590	2.05882352941	It's tough to watch, but it's a fantastic movie.
1591	3.36842105263	The best animated feature to hit theaters since Beauty and the Beast 11 years ago.
1592	1.15789473684	What saves this deeply affecting film from being merely a collection of wrenching cases is Corcuera's attention to detail.
1593	3.0	Pacino is the best he's been in years and Keener is marvelous.
1594	2.31578947368	A solid, spooky entertainment worthy of the price of a ticket.
1595	2.21052631579	By turns fanciful, grisly and engagingly quixotic.
1596	2.73684210526	... very funny, very enjoyable ...
1597	1.94736842105	Adaptation is intricately constructed and in a strange way nails all of Orlean's themes without being a true adaptation of her book.
1598	2.21052631579	So purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it's a fairly straightforward remake of Hollywood comedies such as Father of the Bride.
1599	1.89473684211	Moonlight Mile gives itself the freedom to feel contradictory things. It is sentimental but feels free to offend, is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters, is about grief and yet permits laughter.
1600	2.05263157895	The real triumphs in Igby come from Philippe, who makes Oliver far more interesting than the character's lines would suggest, and Sarandon, who couldn't be better as a cruel but weirdly likable WASP matron.
1601	1.73684210526	Robin Williams has thankfully ditched the saccharine sentimentality of Bicentennial Man in favour of an altogether darker side.

1604	2.52631578947	Hoffman's performance is authentic to the core of his being.
1605	1.52631578947	Told just proficiently enough to trounce its overly comfortable trappings.
1606	2.73684210526	An enthralling aesthetic experience, one that's steeped in mystery and a ravishing, baroque beauty.
1607	2.52631578947	The quirky drama touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance by Rachel Griffiths.
1608	2.42105263158	A captivating coming of age story that may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless age.

1615	1.84210526316	An exhilarating serving of movie fluff.
1616	2.15789473684	Maelstrom is strange and compelling, engrossing and different, a moral tale with a twisted sense of humor.
1617	2.31578947368	It makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small budget film.
1618	1.52631578947	Dark and disturbing, yet compelling to watch.
1619	-0.421052631579	Too often, Son of the Bride becomes an exercise in trying to predict when a preordained ''big moment'' will occur and not ''if.''
1620	1.84210526316	The picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life, but also acknowledging the places, and the people, from whence you came.
1621	1.52941176471	A solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy.
1622	2.47058823529	A terrific insider look at the star making machinery of tinseltown.
1623	1.29411764706	It's a diverting enough hour and a half for the family audience.
1624	-0.529411764706	A party hearty teen flick that scalds like acid.
1625	2.29411764706	As giddy and whimsical and relevant today as it was 270 years ago.
1626	1.58823529412	The film offers an intriguing what if premise.
1627	2.70588235294	The Pianist is the film Roman Polanski may have been born to make.
1628	1.76470588235	This version does justice both to Stevenson and to the sci fi genre.
1629	2.41176470588	Poignant and delicately complex.
1630	1.94117647059	Enough may pander to our basest desires for payback, but unlike many revenge fantasies, it ultimately delivers.
1631	1.52941176471	Cho's latest comic set isn't as sharp or as fresh as I'm the One That I Want... but it's still damn funny stuff.
1632	1.94117647059	In The Pianist, Polanski is saying what he has long wanted to say, confronting the roots of his own preoccupations and obsessions, and he allows nothing to get in the way.
1633	1.23529411765	Despite the film's shortcomings, the stories are quietly moving.
1634	0.529411764706	Those who love Cinema Paradiso will find the new scenes interesting, but few will find the movie improved.
1635	2.11764705882	If you come from a family that eats, meddles, argues, laughs, kibbitzes and fights together, then go see this delightful comedy.
1636	1.70588235294	This bracingly truthful antidote to Hollywood teenage movies that slather Clearasil over the blemishes of youth captures the combustible mixture of a chafing inner loneliness and desperate grandiosity that tend to characterize puberty.
1637	1.64705882353	The reason to see ''Sade'' lay with the chemistry and complex relationship between the marquis (Auteil) and Emilie (Le Besco).
1638	1.76470588235	It's the filmmakers' post camp comprehension of what made old time B movies good bad that makes Eight Legged Freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion.
1639	1.70588235294	The film's strength isn't in its details, but in the larger picture it paints   of a culture in conflict with itself, with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest, media soaked fears.
1640	1.0	...best seen as speculative history, as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the Warren Report.
1641	1.05882352941	It has its faults, but it is a kind, unapologetic, sweetheart of a movie, and Mandy Moore leaves a positive impression.
1642	1.11764705882	The Saigon of 1952 is an uneasy mix of sensual delights and simmering violence, and The Quiet American brings us right into the center of that world.
1643	1.64705882353	Despite its shortcomings, Girls Can't Swim represents an engaging and intimate first feature by a talented director to watch, and it's a worthy entry in the French coming of age genre.
1644	1.0	Flawed, but worth seeing for Ambrose's performance.
1645	2.47058823529	With Dirty Deeds, David Caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control    driven by a natural sense for what works on screen.
1646	2.41176470588	The humor and humanity of Monsoon Wedding are in perfect balance.
1647	1.11764705882	Lookin' for sin, American style? Try Hell House, which documents the cautionary Christian spook a rama of the same name.
1648	1.94117647059	A compelling motion picture that illustrates an American tragedy.
1649	1.70588235294	As comedic spotlights go, Notorious C.H.O. hits all the verbal marks it should.
1650	1.76470588235	It's a day at the beach    with air conditioning and popcorn.
1651	1.33333333333	Frida isn't that much different from many a Hollywood romance. What sets it apart is the vision that Taymor, the avant garde director of Broadway's The Lion King and the film Titus, brings.
1652	2.05555555556	Stevens has a flair for dialogue comedy, the film operates nicely off the element of surprise, and the large cast is solid.
1653	2.5	Extremely well acted by the four primary actors, this is a seriously intended movie that is not easily forgotten.
1654	1.38888888889	The film exudes the urbane sweetness that Woody Allen seems to have bitterly forsaken.
1655	1.44444444444	K 19: The Widowmaker is derivative, overlong, and bombastic    yet surprisingly entertaining.
1656	1.88888888889	It's good, hard edged stuff, violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done, morally alert and street smart.
1657	1.44444444444	Cineasts will revel in those visual in jokes, as in the film's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of Denmark's Dogma movement.
1658	1.5	It's a rare window on an artistic collaboration.
1659	-0.833333333333	...begins with promise, but runs aground after being snared in its own tangled plot.
1660	3.33333333333	Perhaps the best sports movie I've ever seen.
1661	2.33333333333	Cho's timing is priceless.

1664	2.27777777778	An edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch.
1665	1.5	A reasonably entertaining sequel to 1994's surprise family hit that may strain adult credibility.

1670	2.61111111111	Arteta directs one of the best ensemble casts of the year
1671	1.88888888889	The casting of von Sydow ... is itself Intacto's luckiest stroke.
1672	1.5	No, it's not as single minded as John Carpenter's original, but it's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels.
1673	2.33333333333	A gem of a romantic crime comedy that turns out to be clever, amusing and unpredictable.
1674	2.66666666667	Stands as one of the year's most intriguing movie experiences, letting its imagery speak for it while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be.
1675	2.22222222222	...the first 2/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny, thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices ( cool visual backmasking), a solid cast, and some wickedly sick and twisted humor...
1676	2.0	This movie got me grinning. There's a part of us that cannot help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something.

1679	1.94444444444	This English language version ... does full honor to Miyazaki's teeming and often unsettling landscape, and to the conflicted complexity of his characters.
1680	1.44444444444	The pleasures that it does afford may be enough to keep many moviegoers occupied amidst some of the more serious minded concerns of other year end movies.
1681	1.10526315789	Not everyone will welcome or accept The Trials of Henry Kissinger as faithful portraiture, but few can argue that the debate it joins is a necessary and timely one.
1682	-0.210526315789	There are no special effects, and no Hollywood endings.
1683	1.31578947368	Like the original, this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by Allen's astringent wit.
1684	-0.684210526316	Despite its Hawaiian setting, the science fiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick, the basic plot of ''Lilo'' could have been pulled from a tear stained vintage Shirley Temple script.
1685	0.894736842105	A brutally honest documentary about a much anticipated family reunion that goes wrong thanks to culture shock and a refusal to empathize with others.
1686	2.36842105263	Filled with honest performances and exceptional detail, Baran is a gentle film with dramatic punch, a haunting ode to humanity.

1690	3.52631578947	(Haynes') homage to such films as ''All That Heaven Allows'' and ''Imitation of Life'' transcends them. Simply put, ''Far From Heaven'' is a masterpiece.

1692	-0.842105263158	Although fairly involving as far as it goes, the film doesn't end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up Catholic or, really, anything.
1693	1.05263157895	Proves mainly that South Korean filmmakers can make undemanding action movies with all the alacrity of their Hollywood counterparts.
1694	2.36842105263	A very funny romantic comedy about two skittish New York middle agers who stumble into a relationship and then struggle furiously with their fears and foibles.
1695	2.36842105263	Top notch action powers this romantic drama.
1696	2.10526315789	Beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart. It really is a shame that more won't get an opportunity to embrace small, sweet 'Evelyn.'
1697	2.57894736842	I stopped thinking about how good it all was, and started doing nothing but reacting to it   feeling a part of its grand locations, thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled, feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness, gasping at its visual delights.
1698	2.21052631579	Probably the best case for Christianity since Chesterton and Lewis.

1701	2.05263157895	Visually fascinating ... an often intense character study about fathers and sons, loyalty and duty.
1702	1.78947368421	A lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self discovery and a picaresque view of a little remembered world.
1703	1.26315789474	Schütte's dramatic snapshot of the artist three days before his death offers an interesting bit of speculation as to the issues Brecht faced as his life drew to a close.
1704	2.0	A slick, engrossing melodrama.
1705	1.36842105263	S1M0NE's satire is not subtle, but it is effective. It's a quirky, off beat project.
1706	1.52631578947	While some will object to the idea of a Vietnam picture with such a rah rah, patriotic tone, Soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective: dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation.
1707	1.63157894737	Even if you don't know the band or the album's songs by heart, you will enjoy seeing how both evolve, and you will also learn a good deal about the state of the music business in the 21st Century.
1708	2.63157894737	The solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre.
1709	2.0	Films about loss, grief and recovery are pretty valuable these days. Seen in that light, Moonlight Mile should strike a nerve in many.
1710	2.84210526316	It's endlessly inventive, consistently intelligent and sickeningly savage.

1714	2.57142857143	A movie that both thrills the eye and, in its over the top way, touches the heart.
1715	0.952380952381	Stuffed to the brim with ideas, American instigator Michael Moore's film is a rambling examination of American gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition.
1716	1.42857142857	Affectionately reminds us that, in any language, the huge stuff in life can usually be traced back to the little things.
1717	1.28571428571	A drama of great power, yet some members of the audience will leave the theater believing they have seen a comedy.

1720	2.2380952381	A story about intelligent high school students that deals with first love sweetly but also seriously. It is also beautifully acted.
1721	1.2380952381	It isn't that the picture is unfamiliar, but that it manages to find new avenues of discourse on old problems.
1722	0.047619047619	Same song, second verse, coulda been better, but it coulda been worse.

1724	2.0	Wilco fans will have a great time, and the movie should win the band a few new converts, too.
1725	3.04761904762	Tsai has a well deserved reputation as one of the cinema world's great visual stylists, and in this film, every shot enhances the excellent performances.
1726	1.04761904762	The date movie that Franz Kafka would have made.
1727	0.809523809524	The fact is that the screen is most alive when it seems most likely that Broomfield's interviewees, or even himself, will not be for much longer.
1728	2.7619047619	Leguizamo and Jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb.
1729	2.38095238095	I liked this film a lot...
1730	1.80952380952	...there is enough originality in 'Life' to distance it from the pack of paint by number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens.
1731	2.33333333333	A solid and refined piece of moviemaking imbued with passion and attitude.

1734	1.57142857143	On the surface a silly comedy, Scotland, PA would be forgettable if it weren't such a clever adaptation of the bard's tragic play.
1735	1.2380952381	A weird, arresting little ride.
1736	1.0	A fine film, but it would be a lot better if it stuck to Betty Fisher and left out the other stories.
1737	1.95238095238	A first class road movie that proves you can run away from home, but your ego and all your problems go with you.
1738	-1.19047619048	You might want to take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see ''Simone,'' and consider a DVD rental instead.
1739	2.04761904762	Well cast and well directed   a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin.
1740	2.52380952381	A backstage must see for true fans of comedy.
1741	0.736842105263	There's back stabbing, inter racial desire and, most importantly, singing and dancing.
1742	1.26315789474	The film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama, but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from Paul's perspective.
1743	1.94736842105	Jones ... makes a great impression as the writer director of this little $1.8 million charmer, which may not be cutting edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart.
1744	1.73684210526	In the disturbingly involving family dysfunctional drama How I Killed My Father, French director Anne Fontaine delivers an inspired portrait of male ridden angst and the emotional blockage that accompanies this human condition
1745	1.10526315789	Below may not mark Mr. Twohy's emergence into the mainstream, but his promise remains undiminished.
1746	2.10526315789	There's no reason to miss Interview with the Assassin
1747	1.68421052632	Happily stays close to the ground in a spare and simple manner and doesn't pummel us with phony imagery or music.
1748	1.94736842105	Its sheer dynamism is infectious.

1750	1.31578947368	it somehow managed to make its way past my crappola radar and find a small place in my heart
1751	2.47368421053	Perhaps it's cliche to call the film 'refreshing,' but it is. 'Drumline' shows a level of young, Black manhood that is funny, touching, smart and complicated.
1752	1.78947368421	It does give a taste of the Burning Man ethos, an appealing blend of counter cultural idealism and hedonistic creativity.
1753	0.684210526316	The limited sets and small confined and dark spaces also are homages to a classic low budget film noir movie.
1754	1.0	The movie is well done, but slow.
1755	2.26315789474	(A) wonderfully loopy tale of love, longing, and voting.
1756	1.63157894737	The fascination comes in the power of the Huston performance, which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile, and in the way the Ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react.
1757	2.36842105263	The last scenes of the film are anguished, bitter and truthful. Mr. Koshashvili is a director to watch.
1758	0.736842105263	Predictable storyline and by the book scripting is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director John Stockwell.
1759	1.21052631579	Antwone Fisher certainly does the trick of making us care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories but, with few exceptions, it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it.
1760	1.78947368421	One feels the dimming of a certain ambition, but in its place a sweetness, clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early Italian neorealism.
1761	1.63157894737	It challenges, this nervy oddity, like modern art should.
1762	1.05263157895	Whenever you think you've figured out Late Marriage, it throws you for a loop.
1763	3.26315789474	The Pianist is Polanski's best film.
1764	1.47368421053	It is a testament of quiet endurance, of common concern, of reconciled survival.

1766	1.57894736842	A sensitive, modest comic tragedy that works as both character study and symbolic examination of the huge economic changes sweeping modern China.

1768	3.26315789474	Cusack's just brilliant in this.
1769	2.26315789474	Knows how to make our imagination wonder.
1770	2.63157894737	Jae eun Jeong's Take Care of My Cat brings a beguiling freshness to a coming of age story with such a buoyant, expressive flow of images that it emerges as another key contribution to the flowering of the South Korean cinema.
1771	1.875	The overall fabric is hypnotic, and Mr. Mattei fosters moments of spontaneous intimacy.
1772	0.0	Evokes a palpable sense of disconnection, made all the more poignant by the incessant use of cell phones.
1773	1.875	Malcolm McDowell is cool. Paul Bettany is cool. Paul Bettany playing Malcolm McDowell? Cool.
1774	2.25	A touching, sophisticated film that almost seems like a documentary in the way it captures an Italian immigrant family on the brink of major changes.
1775	0.25	...a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self importance
1776	2.25	An inventive, absorbing movie that's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist.
1777	2.6875	It made me want to get made up and go see this movie with my sisters. I thought the relationships were wonderful, the comedy was funny, and the love 'real'.

1779	2.4375	Bogdanovich puts history in perspective and, via Kirsten Dunst's remarkable performance, he showcases Davies as a young woman of great charm, generosity and diplomacy.
1780	2.0625	This breezy caper movie becomes a soulful, incisive meditation on the way we were, and the way we are.
1781	2.3125	A captivating new film.
1782	1.5625	Those who aren't put off by the film's austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them.
1783	1.875	It's a clear eyed portrait of an intensely lived time, filled with nervous energy, moral ambiguity and great uncertainties.
1784	1.9375	Reveals how important our special talents can be when put in service of of others. It also shows how deeply felt emotions can draw people together across the walls that might otherwise separate them.
1785	1.8125	With the same sort of good natured fun found in films like Tremors, Eight Legged Freaks is prime escapist fare.
1786	2.1875	A sharp, amusing study of the cult of celebrity.
1787	1.5	The sentimental cliches mar an otherwise excellent film. A powerful performance from Mel Gibson and a brutal 90 minute battle sequence that does everything but issue you a dog tag and an M 16.
1788	2.375	A graceful, moving tribute to the courage of New York's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief shared by the nation at their sacrifice.
1789	2.125	A coming of age tale from New Zealand whose boozy, languid air is balanced by a rich visual clarity and deeply felt performances across the board.
1790	1.8125	Made to be Jaglomized is the Cannes Film Festival, the annual Riviera spree of flesh, buzz, blab and money. The charming result is Festival in Cannes.
1791	2.375	If you're looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining, you're in luck.
1792	3.1875	A hugely rewarding experience that's every bit as enlightening, insightful and entertaining as Grant's two best films    Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones's Diary.
1793	2.9375	A rip roaring comedy action fest that'll put hairs on your chest.
1794	1.8125	If there's no art here, it's still a good yarn    which is nothing to sneeze at these days.
1795	2.5	Simultaneously heart breaking and very funny, The Last Kiss is really all about performances.
1796	1.3125	There is a subversive element to this Disney cartoon, providing unexpected fizzability.
1797	2.125	An unforgettable look at morality, family, and social expectation through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage.
1798	1.25	An enjoyable, if occasionally flawed, experiment.
1799	3.1875	Miyazaki is one of world cinema's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers.
1800	1.875	If Ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating, sleeping and stress reducing contemplation, it is clearly a good thing.
1801	3.61111111111	Meeting, even exceeding expectations, it's the best sequel since The Empire Strikes Back ... a majestic achievement, an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth.
1802	3.05555555556	Leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema. He allows his cast members to make creative contributions to the story and dialogue. This method almost never fails him, and it works superbly here.
1803	1.83333333333	Poetry in motion captured on film. While it can be a bit repetitive, overall it's an entertaining and informative documentary.
1804	1.88888888889	Directing with a sure and measured hand, (Haneke) steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology.
1805	2.16666666667	The entire movie establishes a wonderfully creepy mood.
1806	1.83333333333	I found The Ring moderately absorbing, largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound.
1807	1.38888888889	The filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time, and in their cheap, B movie way, they succeed.
1808	2.16666666667	Amari has dressed up this little parable in a fairly irresistible package full of privileged moments and memorable performances.
1809	1.61111111111	Rabbit Proof Fence will probably make you angry. But it will just as likely make you weep, and it will do so in a way that doesn't make you feel like a sucker.
1810	2.38888888889	Both heartbreaking and heartwarming...just a simple fable done in an artless sytle, but it's tremendously moving.
1811	1.83333333333	This masterfully calibrated psychological thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short.
1812	1.72222222222	The film's sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength, but it's propelled by the acting.
1813	2.5	The Pianist (is) a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war's madness remembered that we, today, can prevent its tragic waste of life. Here is a divine monument to a single man's struggle to regain his life, his dignity and his music.

1815	1.83333333333	Elegant, mannered and teasing.
1816	1.44444444444	An average coming of age tale elevated by the wholesome twist of a pesky mother interfering during her son's discovery of his homosexuality.
1817	2.61111111111	The ingenuity that Parker displays in freshening the play is almost in a class with that of Wilde himself.
1818	2.0	Decasia is what has happened already to so many silent movies, newsreels and the like. The unexpected thing is that its dying, in this shower of black and white psychedelia, is quite beautiful.
1819	0.444444444444	A droll, bitchy frolic which pokes fun at the price of popularity and small town pretension in the Lone Star State.
1820	1.83333333333	With each of her three protagonists, Miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman's life, out of a deep seated, emotional need, is about to turn onto a different path.
1821	2.05555555556	Ryan Gosling ... is at 22 a powerful young actor.
1822	1.5	A minor work yet there's no denying the potency of Miller's strange, fleeting brew of hopeful perseverance and hopeless closure.
1823	1.11111111111	As an introduction to the man's theories and influence, Derrida is all but useless; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man, however, it's invaluable.
1824	1.88888888889	The film is a verbal duel between two gifted performers.
1825	1.61111111111	Imperfect? Yes, but also intriguing and honorable, a worthwhile addition to a distinguished film legacy.

1829	1.83333333333	As simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine. This is a movie you can trust.
1830	2.16666666667	Passionate, irrational, long suffering but cruel as a tarantula, Helga figures prominently in this movie, and helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown ups as for rugrats.

1834	-0.25	Maybe Thomas Wolfe was right: You can't go home again.
1835	0.625	A compelling yarn, but not quite a ripping one.
1836	1.75	On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, The Powerpuff Girls is a fast, frenetic, funny, even punny 6    aimed specifically at a grade school audience.
1837	1.9375	The film has several strong performances.
1838	1.5	I've never bought from telemarketers, but I bought this movie.
1839	2.75	Perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy, hope and despair, About Schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live    someplace between consuming self absorption and insistently demanding otherness.
1840	1.25	The funny thing is, I didn't mind all this contrived nonsense a bit.
1841	1.9375	(Shyamalan) turns the goose pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit, purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count.
1842	2.4375	A sexy, peculiar and always entertaining costume drama set in Renaissance Spain, and the fact that it's based on true events somehow makes it all the more compelling.
1843	1.9375	An entertaining documentary that freshly considers arguments the Bard's immortal plays were written by somebody else.
1844	2.25	A highly spirited, imaginative kid's movie that broaches neo Augustinian theology: Is God stuck in Heaven because He's afraid of His best known creation?
1845	1.875	Call it magic realism or surrealism, but Miss Wonton floats beyond reality with a certain degree of wit and dignity.
1846	3.3125	Raimi and his team couldn't have done any better in bringing the story of Spider Man to the big screen.
1847	2.125	The director explores all three sides of his story with a sensitivity and an inquisitiveness reminiscent of Truffaut.
1848	2.125	Well acted, well directed and, for all its moodiness, not too pretentious.
1849	1.8125	It's a satisfying summer blockbuster and worth a look.
1850	1.875	Boomers and their kids will have a Barrie good time.
1851	1.8125	Real Women Have Curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by Ferrera and Ontiveros.
1852	1.5625	Ultimately, ''MIB II'' succeeds due to its rapid fire delivery and enough inspired levity that it can't be dismissed as mindless.

1855	1.4375	The real charm of this trifle is the deadpan comic face of its star, Jean Reno, who resembles Sly Stallone in a hot sake half sleep.
1856	2.3125	What's so fun about this silly, outrageous, ingenious thriller is the director's talent. Watching a Brian DePalma movie is like watching an Alfred Hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers.
1857	0.0	Strip it of all its excess debris, and you'd have a 90 minute, four star movie. As it is, it's too long and unfocused.
1858	2.4375	An immensely entertaining look at some of the unsung heroes of 20th century pop music.
1859	1.375	This familiar rise and fall tale is long on glamour and short on larger moralistic consequences, though it's told with sharp ears and eyes for the tenor of the times.
1860	2.75	This beautifully animated epic is never dull.
1861	2.2	Brian Tufano's handsome widescreen photography and Paul Grabowsky's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special.
1862	2.2	It makes compelling, provocative and prescient viewing.
1863	1.9	A thoroughly entertaining comedy that uses Grant's own twist of acidity to prevent itself from succumbing to its own bathos.
1864	1.7	Using a stock plot, About a Boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater.
1865	1.95	What Eric Schaeffer has accomplished with Never Again may not, strictly speaking, qualify as revolutionary. But it's defiantly and delightfully against the grain.
1866	2.3	The hard to predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down to earth Bullock and the nonchalant Grant proves to be sensational, and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment.
1867	2.45	A positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue, betrayal, deceit and murder of a Shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera.
1868	1.55	Mr. Clooney, Mr. Kaufman and all their collaborators are entitled to take a deep bow for fashioning an engrossing entertainment out of an almost sure fire prescription for a critical and commercial disaster.

1876	2.15	The film has a terrific look and Salma Hayek has a feel for the character at all stages of her life.
1877	-1.15	A decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies.
1878	2.6	The performances are remarkable.
1879	1.3	It's Burns' visuals, characters and his punchy dialogue, not his plot, that carry waydowntown.
1880	0.65	As literary desecrations go, this makes for perfectly acceptable, occasionally very enjoyable children's entertainment. You'll forget about it by Monday, though, and if they're old enough to have developed some taste, so will your kids.
1881	1.2	While I can't say it's on par with the first one, Stuart Little 2 is a light, fun cheese puff of a movie.

1887	1.95	An entertaining British hybrid of comedy, caper thrills and quirky romance.
1888	0.85	Alain Choquart's camera barely stops moving, portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving Conduct a perpetual sense of urgency, which, for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool, is both funny and irritating.
1889	1.1	Mostly Martha could have used a little trimming    10 or 15 minutes could be cut and no one would notice    but it's a pleasurable trifle. The only pain you'll feel as the credits roll is your stomach grumbling for some tasty grub.
1890	1.35	Hardly an objective documentary, but it's great cinematic polemic...love Moore or loathe him, you've got to admire...the intensity with which he's willing to express his convictions.

1894	2.13043478261	What makes the movie work    to an admittedly limited extent    is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers. Weaver and LaPaglia are both excellent, in the kind of low key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk.
1895	2.08695652174	Even the digressions are funny.
1896	2.34782608696	Mr. Spielberg and his company just want you to enjoy yourselves without feeling conned. And they succeed merrily at their noble endeavor.

1898	1.5652173913	A perfectly pleasant if slightly pokey comedy.
1899	1.60869565217	Coppola's directorial debut is an incredibly layered and stylistic film that, despite a fairly slow paced, almost humdrum approach to character development, still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema.

1902	1.65217391304	It's hard to imagine anybody ever being ''in the mood'' to view a movie as harrowing and painful as The Grey Zone, but it's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it's started.
1903	1.91304347826	Bogdanovich taps deep into the Hearst mystique, entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal.

1908	2.69565217391	A fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor, sensuality, and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys.
1909	1.39130434783	Lawrence plumbs personal tragedy and also the human comedy.
1910	0.565217391304	Though a capable thriller, somewhere along the way K 19 jettisoned some crucial drama.

1912	1.26086956522	It would be disingenuous to call Reno a great film, but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex. This is a movie that is what it is: a pleasant distraction, a Friday night diversion, an excuse to eat popcorn.
1913	1.47826086957	There is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work, but it is nevertheless compelling.

1915	2.86956521739	A delicious, quirky movie with a terrific screenplay and fanciful direction by Michael Gondry.
1916	2.0	This story still seems timely and important. And there's an element of heartbreak to watching it now, with older and wiser eyes, because we know what will happen after Greene's story ends.
1917	1.73913043478	The bodily function jokes are about what you'd expect, but there are rich veins of funny stuff in this movie.
1918	2.08695652174	The performances are amiable and committed, and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye.
1919	1.65217391304	This time, the hype is quieter, and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first, it's still a rollicking good time for the most part.
1920	1.95652173913	There's plenty to enjoy    in no small part thanks to Lau.
1921	1.0	With a romantic comedy plotline straight from the ages, this Cinderella story doesn't have a single surprise up its sleeve. But it does somehow manage to get you under its spell.
1922	2.36842105263	Though few will argue that it ranks with the best of Herzog's works, Invincible shows he's back in form, with an astoundingly rich film.
1923	2.36842105263	''Catch Me'' feels capable of charming the masses with star power, a pop induced score and sentimental moments that have become a Spielberg trademark.
1924	1.21052631579	By no means a great movie, but it is a refreshingly forthright one.
1925	1.89473684211	The casting of Raymond J. Barry as the 'assassin' greatly enhances the quality of Neil Burger's impressive fake documentary.
1926	2.52631578947	Despite Besson's high profile name being Wasabi's big selling point, there is no doubt that Krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film's thoroughly winning tone.
1927	3.15789473684	This documentary is a dazzling, remarkably unpretentious reminder of what (Evans) had, lost, and got back.
1928	2.21052631579	A thoughtful movie, a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one's actions.
1929	2.21052631579	As satisfyingly odd and intriguing a tale as it was a century and a half ago...has a delightfully dour, deadpan tone and stylistic consistency.
1930	1.78947368421	Methodical, measured, and gently tedious in its comedy, Secret Ballot is a purposefully reductive movie    which may be why it's so successful at lodging itself in the brain.
1931	1.21052631579	A witty, trenchant, wildly unsentimental but flawed look at the ins and outs of modern moviemaking.
1932	1.68421052632	For most of the distance the picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche.
1933	1.26315789474	By the standards of knucklehead swill, The Hot Chick is pretty damned funny.

1935	2.26315789474	(Reaches) wholly believable and heart wrenching depths of despair.
1936	2.26315789474	An absorbing and unsettling psychological drama.
1937	2.21052631579	This movie may not have the highest production values you've ever seen, but it's the work of an artist, one whose view of America, history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep.
1938	0.631578947368	Though it's not very well shot or composed or edited, the score is too insistent and the dialogue is frequently overwrought and crudely literal, the film shatters you in waves.
1939	3.26315789474	The entire cast is extraordinarily good.
1940	2.52631578947	Yakusho, as always, is wonderful as the long faced sad sack ... and his chemistry with Shimizu is very believable.
1941	1.89473684211	Young Hanks and Fisk, who vaguely resemble their celebrity parents, bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera to the work.
1942	2.52631578947	A captivatingly quirky hybrid of character portrait, romantic comedy and beat the clock thriller.
1943	2.78947368421	The film sparkles with the the wisdom and humor of its subjects.
1944	1.52631578947	If (Jaglom's) latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling, some of its repartee is still worth hearing.
1945	2.94736842105	Like The English Patient and The Unbearable Lightness of Being, The Hours is one of those reputedly ''unfilmable'' novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right.

1950	2.68421052632	A winning piece of work filled with love for the movies of the 1960s.

1955	2.25	Jackson and co have brought back the value and respect for the term epic cinema.
1956	0.875	It may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie's various victimized audience members after a while, but it also happens to be the movie's most admirable quality
1957	2.6875	Charlotte Sometimes is a brilliant movie. It is about irrational, unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity.
1958	1.25	A delightful stimulus for the optic nerves, so much that it's forgivable that the plot feels like every other tale of a totalitarian tomorrow.
1959	2.0625	Defies logic, the laws of physics and almost anyone's willingness to believe in it. But darned if it doesn't also keep us riveted to our seats.

1964	1.625	A smart, arch and rather cold blooded comedy.
1965	1.8125	Keenly observed and refreshingly natural, Swimming gets the details right, from its promenade of barely clad bodies in Myrtle Beach, S.C., to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner.

1967	2.375	Davis ... gets vivid performances from her cast and pulls off some deft Ally McBeal style fantasy sequences.
1968	1.375	'it's better to go in knowing full well what's going to happen, but willing to let the earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists. Cynics need not apply.'
1969	2.625	Funny, somber, absurd, and, finally, achingly sad, Bartleby is a fine, understated piece of filmmaking.
1970	0.6875	''Red Dragon'' is entertaining. An obvious copy of one of the best films ever made, how could it not be? But it is entertaining on an inferior level. It is a popcorn film, not a must own, or even a must see.
1971	1.1875	Succeeds only because Bullock and Grant were made to share the silver screen.
1972	1.5	Both flawed and delayed, Martin Scorcese's Gangs of New York still emerges as his most vital work since GoodFellas.

1977	3.125	Beautifully shot, delicately scored and powered by a set of heartfelt performances, it's a lyrical endeavour.
1978	1.0625	A macabre and very stylized Swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters.
1979	2.125	A stylistic romp that's always fun to watch.
1980	2.4375	Informative, intriguing, observant, often touching...gives a human face to what's often discussed in purely abstract terms.

1982	1.75	An honest, sensitive story from a Vietnamese point of view.
1983	2.1875	A buoyant romantic comedy about friendship, love, and the truth that we're all in this together.

1992	1.875	A witty, whimsical feature debut.
1993	2.625	Warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people, relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message. I loved this film.
1994	0.4375	It provides a grim, upsetting glimpse at the lives of some of the 1.2 million Palestinians who live in the crowded cities and refugee camps of Gaza.
1995	1.375	Clint Eastwood's Blood Work is a lot like a well made PB&amp; J sandwich: familiar, fairly uneventful and boasting no real surprises – but still quite tasty and inviting all the same.
1996	1.0	A movie that will surely be profane, politically charged music to the ears of Cho's fans.
1997	1.5	Much of this slick and sprightly CGI feature is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings.
1998	2.625	Rarely, a movie is more than a movie. Go.
1999	2.125	Jacquot's strategy allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances ... while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself.

2001	1.4375	By not averting his eyes, Solondz forces us to consider the unthinkable, the unacceptable, the unmentionable.
2002	0.0	One Hour Photo may seem disappointing in its generalities, but it's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director Mark Romanek's self conscious scrutiny to happen, that finally get under your skin.
2003	1.5625	While general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of Cuban music, they'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds.
2004	2.125	A fascinating documentary that provides a rounded and revealing overview of this ancient holistic healing system
2005	1.75	Birthday Girl lucks out with Chaplin and Kidman, who are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story, but who can also negotiate the movie's darker turns.
2006	1.4375	An interesting look behind the scenes of Chicago based rock group Wilco...
2007	0.6875	Sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness run through its otherwise comic narrative.

2009	1.0	Rock solid family fun out of the gates, extremely imaginative through out, but wanes in the middle
2010	1.0625	The Ya Ya's have many secrets and one is   the books are better. Translating complex characters from novels to the big screen is an impossible task but they are true to the essence of what it is to be Ya Ya.
2011	1.13333333333	The touch is generally light enough and the performances, for the most part, credible.
2012	0.666666666667	I liked About Schmidt a lot, but I have a feeling that I would have liked it much more if Harry &amp; Tonto never existed.

2014	0.933333333333	That Storytelling has value cannot be denied. Not even Solondz's thirst for controversy, sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it.

2019	0.933333333333	In all fairness, I must report that the children of varying ages in my audience never coughed, fidgeted or romped up and down the aisles for bathroom breaks.
2020	1.53333333333	As gory as the scenes of torture and self mutilation may be, they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an Asian landscape painting.
2021	1.46666666667	Efficient, suitably anonymous chiller.
2022	1.33333333333	Gorgeous scenes, masterful performances, but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet's mouth.
2023	1.8	The hot topics of the plot are relegated to the background    a welcome step forward from the Sally Jesse Raphael atmosphere of films like Philadelphia and American Beauty.
2024	1.66666666667	It's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them, but Olympia, Wash., based filmmakers Anne de Marcken and Marilyn Freeman did just that and it's what makes their project so interesting.

2026	2.73333333333	Executed with such gentle but insistent sincerity, with such good humor and appreciation of the daily grind that only the most hardhearted Scrooge could fail to respond.
2027	1.8	The gentle comic treatment of adolescent sturm und drang should please fans of Chris Fuhrman's posthumously published cult novel.

2029	3.0	A deftly entertaining film, smartly played and smartly directed.
2030	0.533333333333	A documentary to make the stones weep    as shameful as it is scary.
2031	1.73333333333	I hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness.
2032	1.13333333333	A thought provoking look at how Western foreign policy   however well intentioned   can wreak havoc in other cultures.
2033	1.06666666667	Asks what truth can be discerned from non firsthand experience, and specifically questions cinema's capability for recording truth.
2034	1.93333333333	The journey to the secret's eventual discovery is a separate adventure, and thrill enough.
2035	1.46666666667	A quiet, disquieting triumph.
2036	2.0	Darkly funny and frequently insightful.
2037	1.6	...the tale of her passionate, tumultuous affair with Musset unfolds as Sand's masculine persona, with its love of life and beauty, takes form.

2041	1.375	A film of ideas and wry comic mayhem.
2042	0.4375	At its worst the screenplay is callow, but at its best it is a young artist's thoughtful consideration of fatherhood.
2043	1.375	A worthwhile documentary, whether you're into rap or not, even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll.
2044	0.8125	Fessenden's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy.
2045	-1.625	That the film opens with maggots crawling on a dead dog is not an out of place metaphor.
2046	3.0625	Stanley Kwan has directed not only one of the best gay love stories ever made, but one of the best love stories of any stripe.
2047	1.875	The concert footage is stirring, the recording sessions are intriguing, and    on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity    this quality band may pick up new admirers.

2056	1.9375	Isabelle Huppert excels as the enigmatic Mika and Anna Mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of Chabrol's most intense psychological mysteries.
2057	0.75	Perhaps not since Nelson Eddy crooned his Indian Love Call to Jeanette MacDonald has there been a movie so unabashedly Canadian, not afraid to risk American scorn or disinterest.
2058	0.625	Wedding feels a bit anachronistic. Still, not every low budget movie must be quirky or bleak, and a happy ending is no cinematic sin.
2059	1.6875	It's still a comic book, but Maguire makes it a comic book with soul.
2060	2.5	Brings to a spectacular completion one of the most complex, generous and subversive artworks of the last decade.
2061	2.0625	An amusing and unexpectedly insightful examination of sexual jealousy, resentment and the fine line between passion and pretence.
2062	2.5625	A fascinating, bombshell documentary that should shame Americans, regardless of whether or not ultimate blame finally lies with Kissinger. Should be required viewing for civics classes and would be public servants alike.
2063	2.8125	Adaptation's success in engaging the audience in the travails of creating a screenplay is extraordinary.
2064	2.5625	A polished and vastly entertaining caper film that puts the sting back into the con.

2069	1.875	This may be Burns's strongest film since The Brothers McMullen.

2074	1.04347826087	A sly female empowerment movie, although not in a way anyone would expect.
2075	1.86956521739	You really have to salute writer director Haneke (he adapted Elfriede Jelinek's novel) for making a film that isn't nearly as graphic but much more powerful, brutally shocking and difficult to watch.
2076	2.82608695652	It's a wonderful, sobering, heart felt drama.
2077	1.5652173913	Runs on the pure adrenalin of Pacino's performance.
2078	-0.304347826087	The Paradiso's rusted out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film's final (restored) third...emotionally belittle a cinema classic. Sometimes shorter is better.
2079	1.78260869565	Phillip Noyce and all of his actors    as well as his cinematographer, Christopher Doyle    understand the delicate forcefulness of Greene's prose, and it's there on the screen in their version of The Quiet American.
2080	2.21739130435	The film just might turn on many people to opera, in general, an art form at once visceral and spiritual, wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty    and as emotionally grand as life.
2081	2.08695652174	As a vehicle to savour Binoche's skill, the film is well worthwhile.
2082	1.82608695652	The huskies are beautiful, the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent.
2083	1.13043478261	Whatever complaints I might have, I'd take (its) earnest errors and hard won rewards over the bombastic self glorification of other feel good fiascos like Antwone Fisher or The Emperor's Club any time.

2087	1.65217391304	Combine the paranoid claustrophobia of a submarine movie with the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural    why didn't Hollywood think of this sooner?
2088	1.26086956522	Like Kubrick, Soderbergh isn't afraid to try any genre and to do it his own way.
2089	1.17391304348	Nothing can detract from the affection of that moral favorite: friends will be friends through thick and thin.
2090	1.5652173913	If the film has a problem, its shortness disappoints: You want the story to go on and on.
2091	1.4347826087	Unlike most anime, whose most ardent fans outside Japan seem to be introverted young men with fantasy fetishes, Metropolis never seems hopelessly juvenile.

2132	1.15789473684	Muccino seems to be exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they don't have, and how this gets us in trouble. But even while his characters are acting horribly, he is always sympathetic.
2133	1.63157894737	Whether or not you buy Mr. Broomfield's findings, the film acquires an undeniable entertainment value as the slight, pale Mr. Broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover.

2154	1.26315789474	While there are times when the film's reach exceeds its grasp, the production works more often than it doesn't.
2155	-0.736842105263	While Scorsese's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that ''Gangs'' is never lethargic, the movie is hindered by a central plot that's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about.
2156	2.63157894737	Watching this gentle, mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time, you barely realize your mind is being blown.

2165	1.4	Drug abuse, infidelity and death aren't usually comedy fare, but Turpin's film allows us to chuckle through the angst.
2166	1.93333333333	While Insomnia is in many ways a conventional, even predictable remake, Nolan's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends (it) stimulating depth.

2173	2.06666666667	While Parker and co writer Catherine di Napoli are faithful to Melville's plotline, they and a fully engaged supporting cast ... have made the old boy's characters more quick witted than any English Lit major would have thought possible.
2174	2.86666666667	A smart, sassy and exceptionally charming romantic comedy.
2175	1.86666666667	There are flaws, but also stretches of impact and moments of awe; we're wrapped up in the characters, how they make their choices, and why.
2176	2.4	A gift to anyone who loves both dance and cinema
2177	1.26666666667	It seems Grant doesn't need the floppy hair and the self deprecating stammers after all.

2185	1.33333333333	For those who are intrigued by politics of the '70s, the film is every bit as fascinating as it is flawed.
2186	1.66666666667	All right, so it's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking, but it is a funny (sometimes hilarious) comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself, a playful spirit and a game cast.

2191	0.0526315789474	You just know something terrible is going to happen. But when it does, you're entirely unprepared.
2192	2.15789473684	It's fun, wispy, wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom.

2199	3.10526315789	Kinnear's performance is a career defining revelation.
2200	1.36842105263	The film is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol.

2204	2.21052631579	You may be captivated, as I was, by its moods, and by its subtly transformed star, and still wonder why Paul Thomas Anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which Adam Sandler will probably ever appear.
2205	2.05263157895	There is no substitute for on screen chemistry, and when Friel pulls the strings that make Williams sink into melancholia, the reaction in Williams is as visceral as a gut punch.

2215	0.0526315789474	Lohman adapts to the changes required of her, but the actress and director Peter Kosminsky never get the audience to break through the wall her character erects
2216	1.52631578947	Although it includes a fair share of dumb drug jokes and predictable slapstick, ''Orange County'' is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be.
2217	0.947368421053	For a movie audience, The Hours doesn't connect in a neat way, but introduces characters who illuminate mysteries of sex, duty and love.

2230	2.94117647059	It's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful, all at once.
2231	2.35294117647	At 78 minutes it just zings along with vibrance and warmth.

2233	0.529411764706	Sometimes this 'Blood' seems as tired as its protagonist...Still, the pulse never disappears entirely, and the picture crosses the finish line winded but still game.

2240	2.58823529412	These three films form a remarkably cohesive whole, both visually and thematically, through their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment of an ignored people.
2241	2.23529411765	A funny and well contructed black comedy where the old adage ''be careful what you wish for'' is given a full workout.
2242	1.0	It reaffirms life as it looks in the face of death.
2243	0.647058823529	The film is reasonably entertaining, though it begins to drag two thirds through, when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy.
2244	1.58823529412	This is more fascinating    being real    than anything seen on Jerry Springer.

2246	1.94117647059	Williams plays Sy, another of his open faced, smiling madmen, like the killer in Insomnia. He does this so well you don't have the slightest difficulty accepting him in the role.
2247	2.94117647059	Twist open the Ouzo! It's time to let your hair down – Greek style. A vibrant whirlwind of love, family and all that goes with it, My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a non stop funny feast of warmth, colour and cringe.
2248	1.76470588235	Thought provoking and stylish, if also somewhat hermetic.
2249	2.29411764706	Broomfield is energized by Volletta Wallace's maternal fury, her fearlessness, and because of that, his film crackles.
2250	1.52941176471	While it has definite weaknesses    like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending    this '60s caper film is a riveting, brisk delight.

2252	1.48148148148	If cinema had been around to capture the chaos of France in the 1790's, one imagines the result would look like something like this.
2253	2.0	It's a talking head documentary, but a great one.
2254	0.851851851852	The Fast Runner' transports the viewer into an unusual space
2255	0.851851851852	Ultimately engages less for its story of actorly existential despair than for its boundary hopping formal innovations and glimpse into another kind of Chinese 'cultural revolution.'
2256	2.0	...a solid, well formed satire.
2257	1.18518518519	As part of Mr. Dong's continuing exploration of homosexuality in America, Family Fundamentals is an earnest study in despair.
2258	1.25925925926	Most consumers of lo mein and General Tso's chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it, so, hopefully, this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons.

2263	2.22222222222	Thanks to The Château's balance of whimsicality, narrative discipline and serious improvisation, almost every relationship and personality in the film yields surprises.
2264	1.2962962963	Alan and his fellow survivors are idiosyncratic enough to lift the movie above its playwriting 101 premise.
2265	1.96296296296	Fresh and raw like a blown out vein, Narc takes a walking dead, cop flick subgenre and beats new life into it.
2266	1.11111111111	The premise of Jason X is silly but strangely believable.
2267	2.77777777778	It's a wise and powerful tale of race and culture forcefully told, with superb performances throughout.
2268	2.62962962963	An awfully good, achingly human picture.

2274	2.2962962963	Toes the fine line between cheese and earnestness remarkably well; everything is delivered with such conviction that it's hard not to be carried away.
2275	1.74074074074	Whereas Oliver Stone's conspiracy thriller JFK was long, intricate, star studded and visually flashy, Interview with the Assassin draws its considerable power from simplicity.
2276	2.66666666667	Funny, sexy, devastating and incurably romantic.
2277	1.96296296296	Triple X is a double agent, and he's one bad dude. When you've got the wildly popular Vin Diesel in the equation, it adds up to big box office bucks all but guaranteed.
2278	2.81481481481	Very well written and very well acted.
2279	2.48148148148	A powerful and telling story that examines forbidden love, racial tension, and other issues that are as valid today as they were in the 1950s.
2280	0.037037037037	You emerge dazed, confused as to whether you've seen pornography or documentary.
2281	1.16	It ain't art, by a long shot, but unlike last year's lame Musketeer, this Dumas adaptation entertains.
2282	1.64	likeable thanks to its cast, its cuisine and its quirky tunes.
2283	1.32	Chilling in its objective portrait of dreary, lost twenty first century America.
2284	2.8	Highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it.
2285	2.28	... there's enough cool fun here to warm the hearts of animation enthusiasts of all ages.
2286	1.16	It manages to squeeze by on Angelina Jolie's surprising flair for self deprecating comedy.
2287	2.16	Secretary manages a neat trick, bundling the flowers of perversity, comedy and romance into a strangely tempting bouquet of a movie.
2288	2.52	Judith and Zaza's extended bedroom sequence ... is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics.
2289	1.16	Photographed with melancholy richness and eloquently performed yet also decidedly uncinematic.
2290	1.72	A knowing look at female friendship, spiked with raw urban humor.
2291	1.48	As I settled into my World War II memories, I found myself strangely moved by even the corniest and most hackneyed contrivances.
2292	2.12	The overall effect is awe and affection    and a strange urge to get on a board and, uh, shred, dude.
2293	2.52	It's that rare family movie    genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor.
2294	1.84	The Trinity Assembly approaches the endeavor with a shocking lack of irony, and George Ratliff's documentary, Hell House, reflects their earnestness    which makes for a terrifying film.
2295	1.68	Confessions may not be a straightforward bio, nor does it offer much in the way of Barris' motivations, but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture.
2296	2.0	A special kind of movie, this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of Memento...
2297	2.44	Simple, poignant and leavened with humor, it's a film that affirms the nourishing aspects of love and companionship.
2298	2.4	Together, Miller, Kuras and the actresses make Personal Velocity into an intricate, intimate and intelligent journey.

2301	1.44	Less front loaded and more shapely than the two hour version released here in 1990.
2302	1.32	Watching War Photographer, you come to believe that Nachtwey hates the wars he shows and empathizes with the victims he reveals.
2303	2.08	(A) real pleasure in its laid back way.
2304	0.6	Some may choose to interpret the film's end as hopeful or optimistic but I think Payne is after something darker.
2305	2.28	Though it runs 163 minutes, Safe Conduct is anything but languorous. It's packed to bursting with incident, and with scores of characters, some fictional, some from history.
2306	2.28	A much better documentary    more revealing, more emotional and more surprising    than its pedestrian English title would have you believe.
2307	1.56	Notwithstanding my problem with the movie's final half hour, I'm going to recommend SECRETARY, based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by Spader and Gyllenhaal, and also the unique way Shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl
2308	2.68	A well crafted film that is all the more remarkable because it achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation with restraint and a delicate ambiguity.
2309	1.76	The film has the uncanny ability to right itself precisely when you think it's in danger of going wrong.
2310	3.04	My Big Fat Greek Wedding is that rare animal known as 'a perfect family film,' because it's about family.
2311	2.0	would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed 'The French Lieutenant's Woman.'
2312	1.73333333333	... with the gifted Pearce on hand to keep things on semi stable ground dramatically, this retooled Machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest, crowd pleasing goals it sets for itself.
2313	-0.2	A movie that's just plain awful but still manages to entertain on a guilty pleasure, so bad it's funny level.
2314	0.0	A disoriented but occasionally disarming saga packed with moments out of an Alice in Wonderland adventure, a stalker thriller, and a condensed season of TV's Big Brother.
2315	1.46666666667	Functions as both a revealing look at the collaborative process and a timely, tongue in cheek profile of the corporate circus that is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing.
2316	0.6	With a confrontational stance, Todd Solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families.
2317	-0.533333333333	A mess, but it's a sincere mess.
2318	-1.33333333333	This odd, distant Portuguese import more or less borrows from Bad Lieutenant and Les Vampires, and comes up with a kind of art house gay porn film.
2319	1.2	For a debut film, Skin of Man, Heart of Beast feels unusually assured.
2320	1.53333333333	A photographic marvel of sorts, and it's certainly an invaluable record of that special fishy community.
2321	1.26666666667	It's soulful and unslick, and that's apparently just what (Aniston) has always needed to grow into a movie career.
2322	0.933333333333	Although Olivier Assayas' elegantly appointed period drama seems, at times, padded with incident in the way of a too conscientious adaptation ... its three hour running time plays closer to two.
2323	2.86666666667	A jaw droppingly beautiful work that upends nearly every cliché of Japanese animation while delivering a more than satisfactory amount of carnage.
2324	1.53333333333	Terry is a sort of geriatric Dirty Harry, which will please Eastwood's loyal fans    and suits the story, wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man.
2325	-0.266666666667	Parts seem like they were lifted from Terry Gilliam's subconscious, pressed through Kafka's meat grinder and into Buñuel's casings
2326	1.06666666667	'Like a child with an important message to tell...(Skins') faults are easy to forgive because the intentions are lofty.'
2327	2.33333333333	A delightful entree in the tradition of food movies.
2328	2.8	An escapist confection that's pure entertainment.
2329	0.133333333333	The Ring is worth a look, if you don't demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your Halloween entertainment.
2330	1.2	The movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding, emotional, Rocky like moments ... but it's such a warm and charming package that you'll feel too happy to argue much.
2331	1.0	Throwing it all away for the fleeting joys of love's brief moment.
2332	2.6	Armed with a game supporting cast, from the pitch perfect Forster to the always hilarious Meara and Levy, Like Mike shoots and scores, doing its namesake proud.
2333	1.8	A decent enough nail biter that stands a good chance of being the big hit Franklin needs to stay afloat in Hollywood.
2334	2.13333333333	Begins like a docu drama but builds its multi character story with a flourish.
2335	2.86666666667	One of the most genuinely sweet films to come along in quite some time.
2336	1.8	After an uncertain start, Murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with Bullock's memorable first interrogation of Gosling.
2337	2.4	The story ultimately takes hold and grips hard.
2338	1.33333333333	A bit of a downer and a little over dramatic at times, but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that French realism.
2339	2.6	An emotionally strong and politically potent piece of cinema.
2340	2.2	Enticing and often funny documentary.
2341	1.13333333333	Going to this movie is a little like chewing whale blubber   it's an acquired taste that takes time to enjoy, but it's worth it, even if it does take 3 hours to get through.
2342	0.2	A portrait of hell so shattering it's impossible to shake.
2343	1.6	Almodovar is an imaginative teacher of emotional intelligence in this engaging film about two men who discover what William James once called 'the gift of tears.'
2344	0.8	Better than the tepid Star Trek: Insurrection; falls short of First Contact because the villain couldn't pick the lint off Borg Queen Alice Krige's cape; and finishes half a parsec (a nose) ahead of Generations.
2345	1.2	At times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated (depending upon where you live), Ignorant Fairies is still quite good natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two.
2346	1.8	Tense, terrific, sweaty palmed fun.
2347	2.13333333333	Majidi's direction has never been smoother or more confident.
2348	2.6	What a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is.
2349	2.0	Hard, endearing, caring, warm. Bring tissues.
2350	1.53333333333	A thriller with an edge    which is to say that it doesn't follow the stale, standard, connect the dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world.
2351	1.33333333333	''Me Without You'' is a probing examination of a female friendship set against a few dynamic decades.
2352	1.2	Inherently caustic and oddly whimsical, the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss.
2353	1.53333333333	Though Frodo's quest remains unfulfilled, a hardy group of determined New Zealanders has proved its creative mettle.
2354	1.4	It's a square, sentimental drama that satisfies, as comfort food often can.
2355	2.4	Pure cinematic intoxication, a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama, tastelessness and swooning elegance.
2356	2.4	Ramsay is clearly extraordinarily talented, and based on three short films and two features, here's betting her third feature will be something to behold.
2357	1.06666666667	I was impressed by how many tit for tat retaliatory responses the filmmakers allow before pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an American Russian Armageddon.
2358	1.8	A classy, sprightly spin on film.
2359	0.866666666667	fast, frantic and fun, but also soon forgotten
2360	1.6	A spiffy animated feature about an unruly adolescent boy who is yearning for adventure and a chance to prove his worth.
2361	1.73333333333	Devos and Cassel have tremendous chemistry    their sexual and romantic tension, while never really vocalized, is palpable.
2362	0.933333333333	Fulfills the minimum requirement of Disney animation.
2363	1.46666666667	A moving, if uneven, success.
2364	0.333333333333	With one exception, every blighter in this particular South London housing project digs into dysfunction like it's a big, comforting jar of Marmite, to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness.
2365	2.46666666667	Wickedly funny, visually engrossing, never boring, this movie challenges us to think about the ways we consume pop culture.
2366	2.06666666667	There's plenty to impress about E.T.
2367	1.26666666667	A chronicle not only of one man's quest to be president, but of how that man single handedly turned a plane full of hard bitten, cynical journalists into what was essentially, by campaign's end, an extended publicity department.
2368	1.26666666667	Until it goes off the rails in its final 10 or 15 minutes, Wendigo, Larry Fessenden's spooky new thriller, is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films.
2369	1.93333333333	(Woo's) most resonant film since The Killer.
2370	-0.533333333333	Collateral Damage is trash, but it earns extra points by acting as if it weren't.
2371	1.17647058824	A whole lot of fun and funny in the middle, though somewhat less hard hitting at the start and finish.
2372	1.70588235294	Maybe it is formula filmmaking, but there's nothing wrong with that if the film is well crafted and this one is.
2373	1.76470588235	(Fincher's) camera sense and assured pacing make it an above average thriller.
2374	1.35294117647	The film is insightful about Kissinger's background and history.
2375	2.11764705882	An engrossing portrait of a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly larger than life character.
2376	2.05882352941	A lot of the credit for the film's winning tone must go to Grant, who hasn't lost a bit of the dry humor that first made audiences on both sides of the Atlantic love him.
2377	1.82352941176	Exploits (headbanger) stereotypes in good fun, while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter.
2378	1.35294117647	A journey that is as difficult for the audience to take as it is for the protagonist    yet it's potentially just as rewarding.
2379	1.52941176471	Ratliff's two previous titles, Plutonium Circus and Purgatory County show his penchant for wry, contentious configurations, and this film is part of that delicate canon.
2380	2.88235294118	From its invitingly upbeat overture to its pathos filled but ultimately life affirming finale, Martin is a masterfully conducted work.
2381	1.35294117647	Passions, obsessions, and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits, lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone.
2382	1.82352941176	A comedy that swings and jostles to the rhythms of life.
2383	1.58823529412	At times Auto Focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope. Yet in its own aloof, unreachable way it's so fascinating you won't be able to look away for a second.
2384	0.823529411765	If you're part of her targeted audience, you'll cheer. Otherwise, maybe.
2385	1.88235294118	As animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool, this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth.
2386	0.647058823529	Blade II merges bits and pieces from fighting games, wire fu, horror movies, mystery, James Bond, wrestling, sci fi and anime into one big bloody stew.
2387	1.17647058824	Instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral, Schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view.
2388	1.41176470588	K 19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories, but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of Man confronting the Demons of his own fear and paranoia.
2389	2.0	Contrived as this may sound, Mr. Rose's updating works surprisingly well.
2390	1.11764705882	A glib but bouncy bit of sixties style slickness in which the hero might wind up caught but the audience gets pure escapism.
2391	2.11764705882	You don't need to be a hip hop fan to appreciate Scratch, and that's the mark of a documentary that works.
2392	1.29411764706	Between bursts of automatic gunfire, the story offers a trenchant critique of capitalism.
2393	1.88235294118	Combines improbable melodrama (gored bullfighters, comatose ballerinas) with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements, and yet at the end, we are undeniably touched.
2394	1.0	While the story's undeniably hard to follow, Iwai's gorgeous visuals seduce.
2395	1.52941176471	If you can get past the taboo subject matter, it will be well worth your time.
2396	2.05882352941	A lovely film...elegant, witty and beneath a prim exterior unabashedly romantic...hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source's complexity.
2397	2.0	Scooby Doo is surely everything its fans are hoping it will be, and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation.
2398	3.11764705882	(A) devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid Holocaust drama.
2399	1.76470588235	A solid cast, assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony.
2400	2.17647058824	These characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field, and I'm all for that.
2401	2.53333333333	A sun drenched masterpiece, part parlor game, part psychological case study, part droll social satire.
2402	1.06666666667	Worth a look as a curiosity.
2403	1.33333333333	You watch for that sense of openness, the little surprises.
2404	2.2	Director Peter Kosminsky gives these women a forum to demonstrate their acting 'chops' and they take full advantage.
2405	1.66666666667	Auto Focus is not your standard Hollywood bio pic. Schrader aims to present an unflinching look at one man's downfall, brought about by his lack of self awareness.
2406	2.06666666667	The Bourne Identity shouldn't be half as entertaining as it is, but director Doug Liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood.
2407	0.333333333333	For VeggieTales fans, this is more appetizing than a side dish of asparagus. If you're not a fan, it might be like trying to eat Brussels sprouts.
2408	1.73333333333	Remove Spider Man the movie from its red herring surroundings and it's apparent that this is one summer film that satisfies.
2409	1.6	The whole mildly pleasant outing    the R rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse    remains aloft not on its own self referential hot air, but on the inspired performance of Tim Allen.
2410	2.26666666667	A gorgeously strange movie, Heaven is deeply concerned with morality, but it refuses to spell things out for viewers.
2411	2.13333333333	The Emperor's Club, ruthless in its own placid way, finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie making traditions and gives it new texture, new relevance, new reality.
2412	1.93333333333	It's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter, but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible.
2413	1.06666666667	Though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity, Ozpetek falls short in showing us Antonia's true emotions ... But at the very least, His Secret Life will leave you thinking.
2414	1.8	There is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how, in the flip flop of courtship, we often reel in when we should be playing out.
2415	-0.0666666666667	The message of such reflections  intentional or not  is that while no art grows from a vacuum, many artists exist in one.
2416	0.733333333333	Gooding is the energetic frontman, and it's hard to resist his enthusiasm, even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences.
2417	1.73333333333	The otherwise good naturedness of Mr. Deeds, with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less  than likely New York celebrities ... certainly raises the film above anything Sandler's been attached to before.
2418	3.4	The movie is brilliant, really. It is philosophy, illustrated through everyday events.
2419	2.06666666667	It's stylishly directed with verve...
2420	1.53333333333	Gives an intriguing twist to the French coming of age genre.
2421	1.66666666667	Offers an interesting look at the rapidly changing face of Beijing.
2422	2.0	A solid, psychological action film from Hong Kong.
2423	1.53333333333	See it now, before the inevitable Hollywood remake flattens out all its odd, intriguing wrinkles.
2424	2.0	Holm does his sly, intricate magic, and Iben Hjelje is entirely appealing as Pumpkin.
2425	1.86666666667	An enjoyable feel good family comedy regardless of race.
2426	2.53333333333	Features what is surely the funniest and most accurate depiction of writer's block ever.

2428	1.8	It's bright, pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime.
2429	0.133333333333	In the long, dishonorable history of quickie teen pop exploitation, Like Mike stands out for its only partly synthetic decency.
2430	2.2	Bravo for history rewritten, and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love.
2431	2.27777777778	Lead actress Gaï, she of the impossibly long limbs and sweetly conspiratorial smile, is a towering siren.
2432	2.72222222222	Even if you've seen ''Stomp'' (the stage show), you still have to see this!
2433	2.44444444444	... a light, yet engrossing piece. Lux, now in her eighties, does a great combination act as narrator, Jewish grandmother and subject – taking us through a film that is part biography, part entertainment and part history.
2434	1.0	It's a setup so easy it borders on facile, but keeping the film from cheap shot mediocrity is its crack cast.
2435	1.77777777778	Rife with the rueful, wry humor springing out of Yiddish culture and language.
2436	2.94444444444	A time machine, a journey back to your childhood, when cares melted away in the dark theater, and films had the ability to mesmerize, astonish and entertain.
2437	1.77777777778	Rubbo's humorously tendentious intervention into the who wrote Shakespeare controversy.
2438	2.5	Cantet beautifully illuminates what it means sometimes to be inside looking out, and at other times outside looking in.
2439	1.88888888889	K 19: The Widowmaker is a great yarn.
2440	2.22222222222	It's as raw and action packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough man contest.
2441	1.94444444444	Evokes the frustration, the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up, without relying on the usual tropes.
2442	-1.44444444444	A brilliant gag at the expense of those who paid for it and those who pay to see it.
2443	0.666666666667	Visually striking and viscerally repellent.
2444	1.27777777778	Overcomes its visual hideousness with a sharp script and strong performances.
2445	3.27777777778	Astonishingly skillful and moving...it could become a historically significant work as well as a masterfully made one.
2446	2.83333333333	Beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling...recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly.
2447	3.38888888889	The year 2002 has conjured up more coming of age stories than seem possible, but Take Care of My Cat emerges as the very best of them.
2448	1.27777777778	Although it doesn't always hang together    violence and whimsy don't combine easily    ''Cherish'' certainly isn't dull.
2449	1.88888888889	The sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in IMAX dimensions, as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins.
2450	2.66666666667	Time is a beautiful film to watch, an interesting and at times captivating take on loss and loneliness.
2451	2.05555555556	An intriguing look at the French film industry during the German occupation; its most delightful moments come when various characters express their quirky inner selves.
2452	1.5	A fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience. Judging by those standards, 'Scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary.
2453	1.11111111111	Fubar is very funny, but not always in a laugh out loud way.
2454	1.83333333333	A diverse and astonishingly articulate cast of Palestinian and Israeli children.
2455	1.22222222222	Slight but enjoyable documentary.
2456	1.83333333333	'The film is stark, straightforward and deadly... an unnatural calm that's occasionally shaken by...blasts of rage, and later, violent jealousy.'

2459	2.38888888889	A beguiling evocation of the quality that keeps Dickens evergreen: the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions.
2460	1.83333333333	The heat of the moment prevails. It cooks Conduct in a low, smoky and inviting sizzle.
2461	2.8	A riveting story well told.
2462	1.6	Denis forges out of the theories of class  based rage and sisterly obsession a razor sided tuning fork that rings with cultural, sexual and social discord.
2463	2.65	A compelling pre WWII drama with vivid characters and a warm, moving message.
2464	1.25	The stars may be college kids, but the subject matter is as adult as you can get: the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed, overtly determined young woman and a one night swim turns into an ocean of trouble.
2465	1.8	Pretty good little movie.
2466	2.65	By turns touching, raucously amusing, uncomfortable, and, yes, even sexy, Never Again is a welcome and heartwarming addition to the romantic comedy genre.
2467	2.05	If you haven't seen the film lately, you may be surprised at the variety of tones in Spielberg's work. Much of it is funny, but there are also some startling, surrealistic moments...
2468	-0.6	(The digital effects) reminded me of Terry Gilliam's rudimentary old Monty Python cartoons, in which he would cut out figures from drawings and photographs and paste them together.
2469	1.95	An entertaining mix of period drama and flat out farce that should please history fans.
2470	2.45	Canada's arctic light shines bright on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the Inuit people.
2471	2.5	The fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels    including the physical demands made on Büttner    and it implies in its wake the intractable, irreversible flow of history.
2472	3.75	Alternately hilarious and sad, aggravating and soulful, scathing and joyous. It's a masterpeice.
2473	1.6	The film's messages of tolerance and diversity aren't particularly original, but one can't help but be drawn in by the sympathetic characters.
2474	1.45	Though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem, there's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting.
2475	1.5	A conventional, but well crafted film about a historic legal battle in Ireland over a man's right to raise his own children.
2476	2.75	Yes, it's as good as you remember. In fact, even better.
2477	1.8	Hartley adds enough quirky and satirical touches in the screenplay to keep the film entertaining.
2478	-1.35	An uncomfortable movie, suffocating and sometimes almost senseless, The Grey Zone does have a center, though a morbid one.
2479	0.2	This is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are, and how to push them.
2480	1.75	A stirring road movie.
2481	3.6	One of the best films I have ever seen, constantly pulling the rug from underneath us, seeing things from new sides, plunging deeper, getting more intense.
2482	3.65	Insanely hilarious! I haven't laughed that hard in years!
2483	2.1	Anyone who's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no doubt fantasized about what an unhappy, repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved. These people are really going to love The Piano Teacher.
2484	1.85	It's a tour de force, written and directed so quietly that it's implosion rather than explosion you fear.
2485	2.65	It may not be history – but then again, what if it is? – but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies I've had in a while.
2486	2.75	If ''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' isn't the most edgy piece of Disney animation to hit the silver screen, then this first film to use a watercolor background since ''Dumbo'' certainly ranks as the most original in years.
2487	0.5	This may be Dover Kosashvili's feature directing debut, but it looks an awful lot like life    gritty, awkward and ironic.
2488	1.3	This ready made midnight movie probably won't stand the cold light of day, but under the right conditions, it's goofy (if not entirely wholesome) fun.
2489	2.7	See Scratch for the history, see Scratch for the music, see Scratch for a lesson in scratching, but, most of all, see it for the passion.
2490	1.85	...''Bowling for Columbine'' remains a disquieting and thought provoking film...
2491	0.4	Even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director, it doesn't make for completely empty entertainment
2492	-1.2	But even with the two wrongs make a right chemistry between Jolie and Burns...this otherwise appealing picture loses its soul to Screenwriting For Dummies conformity.
2493	0.8	Talk to Her is so darned assured, we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way    and yet it's hard to stop watching.
2494	2.53333333333	Star/producer Salma Hayek and director Julie Taymor have infused Frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own.
2495	2.93333333333	A truly wonderful tale combined with stunning animation.
2496	1.73333333333	A low key labor of love that strikes a very resonant chord.
2497	1.33333333333	An average kid empowerment fantasy with slightly above average brains.
2498	1.6	Confessions isn't always coherent, but it's sharply comic and surprisingly touching, so hold the gong.
2499	0.933333333333	While Guzmán frustratingly refuses to give Pinochet's crimes a political context, his distance from the material is mostly admirable.
2500	0.733333333333	... a story, an old and scary one, about the monsters we make, and the vengeance they take.
2501	1.4	A sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait of three aging sisters.
2502	0.866666666667	White Oleander may leave you rolling your eyes in the dark, but that doesn't mean you won't like looking at it.
2503	1.33333333333	In painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people, the movie exalts the Marxian dream of honest working folk, with little to show for their labor, living harmoniously, joined in song.
2504	2.86666666667	The most brilliant work in this genre since the 1984 uncut version of Sergio Leone's flawed but staggering Once Upon a Time in America.
2505	1.6	It looks closely, insightfully at fragile, complex relationships.
2506	0.0	Not a bad choice here, assuming that... the air conditioning in the theater is working properly.
2507	1.46666666667	A fine effort, an interesting topic, some intriguing characters and a sad ending. Certainly the big finish wasn't something Galinsky and Hawley could have planned for... but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps.
2508	1.8	It must be the end of the world: the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring Wesley Snipes.
2509	1.13333333333	There are moments of hilarity to be had.
2510	0.733333333333	A hypnotic portrait of this sad, compulsive life.
2511	0.666666666667	(While The Last Metro) was more melodramatic, confined to a single theater company and its strategies and deceptions, while Tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history.
2512	3.4	One of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting, inventive screenplay, mesmerizing music, and many inimitable scenes of tenderness, loss, discontent, and yearning.
2513	1.93333333333	Return to Never Land is reliable, standard Disney animated fare, with enough creative energy and wit to entertain all ages.
2514	2.6	Michael Moore's latest documentary about America's thirst for violence is his best film yet...
2515	0.666666666667	Suffice to say that after seeing this movie in IMAX form, you'll be more acquainted with the tiniest details of Tom Hanks' face than his wife is.
2516	2.53333333333	Like a Tarantino movie with heart, Alias Betty is richly detailed, deftly executed and utterly absorbing.
2517	3.06666666667	Marvelously entertaining and deliriously joyous documentary.
2518	1.93333333333	A brisk, reverent, and subtly different sequel.
2519	3.06666666667	A movie I loved on first sight and, even more important, love in remembrance.
2520	3.4	Deserves a place of honor next to Nanook as a landmark in film history.
2521	1.17647058824	Murderous Maids pulls no punches in its depiction of the lives of the Papin sister and the events that led to their notorious rise to infamy...
2522	2.0	This is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the American underground.
2523	0.823529411765	The Sweetest Thing, a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies, may be a mess in a lot of ways. But it does have one saving grace. A lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point of view.
2524	1.17647058824	This is lightweight filmmaking, to be sure, but it's pleasant enough    and oozing with attractive men.
2525	1.70588235294	At its most basic, this cartoon adventure is that wind in the hair exhilarating.
2526	1.47058823529	Fans of critics' darling band Wilco will marvel at the sometimes murky, always brooding look of I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.
2527	1.52941176471	The film presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet.
2528	2.17647058824	(Gosling's) combination of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence helps create a complex, unpredictable character.
2529	0.470588235294	Confounding because it solemnly advances a daringly preposterous thesis. Acting cannot be acted.
2530	1.82352941176	Fulford Wierzbicki ... deftly captures the wise beyond her years teen.
2531	2.70588235294	A wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films.
2532	1.82352941176	It's a cool event for the whole family. Maybe not a classic, but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again.
2533	-0.470588235294	The movie is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it.
2534	0.764705882353	A typically observant, carefully nuanced and intimate French coming of age film that is an encouraging debut feature but has a needlessly downbeat ending that is too heavy for all that has preceded it.
2535	0.823529411765	Less an examination of neo Nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself.
2536	1.88235294118	A moving and weighty depiction of one family's attempts to heal after the death of a child.
2537	1.05882352941	I don't think most of the people who loved the 1989 Paradiso will prefer this new version. But I do.
2538	1.58823529412	A zinger filled crowd pleaser that open minded Elvis fans (but by no means all) will have fun with.
2539	2.0	Diggs and Lathan are among the chief reasons Brown Sugar is such a sweet and sexy film.
2540	2.94117647059	Entirely suspenseful, extremely well paced and ultimately... dare I say, entertaining!
2541	3.0	The riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make Love a joy to behold.
2542	2.23529411765	Terrific as Nadia, a Russian mail order bride who comes to America speaking not a word of English, it's Kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers.
2543	2.52941176471	With an unflappable air of decadent urbanity, Everett remains a perfect Wildean actor, and a relaxed Firth displays impeccable comic skill.
2544	3.11764705882	The re release of Ron Howard's Apollo 13 in the IMAX format proves absolutely that really, really, really good things can come in enormous packages.
2545	2.64705882353	Very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience.
2546	2.76470588235	Wonderful fencing scenes and an exciting plot make this an eminently engrossing film.
2547	1.52941176471	It's pretty linear and only makeup deep, but Bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period.
2548	2.05882352941	A surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of Hollywood's comic book adaptations.
2549	3.0	This is a superior horror flick.
2550	3.47058823529	Adaptation is simply brilliant.
2551	1.86666666667	Smart and alert, Thirteen Conversations About One Thing is a small gem.
2552	2.13333333333	The pleasure of Read My Lips is like seeing a series of perfect black pearls clicking together to form a string. We're drawn in by the dark luster.
2553	1.26666666667	A haunting tale of murder and mayhem.
2554	2.2	I love the opening scenes of a wintry New York City in 1899. Cinematic poetry showcases the city's old world charm before machines change nearly everything.
2555	2.73333333333	It's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star Jake Gyllenhaal but also from accomplished Oscar winners Susan Sarandon, Dustin Hoffman and Holly Hunter, yet newcomer Ellen Pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb.
2556	3.46666666667	One of the best rock documentaries ever. Wilco is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many.
2557	1.06666666667	Ian Holm conquers France as an earthy Napoleon
2558	1.66666666667	Offers big, fat, dumb laughs that may make you hate yourself for giving in. Ah, what the hell.
2559	2.0	(Sports) admirable energy, full bodied characterizations and narrative urgency.
2560	0.466666666667	A portrait of an artist.
2561	1.93333333333	Directors Brett Morgen and Nanette Burstein have put together a bold biographical fantasia.
2562	1.2	The subtitled costume drama is set in a remote African empire before cell phones, guns, and the internal combustion engine, but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow.
2563	3.26666666667	A tremendous piece of work.
2564	1.86666666667	A delightful, if minor, pastry of a movie.
2565	1.53333333333	While obviously aimed at kids, The Country Bears ... should keep parents amused with its low groan to guffaw ratio.
2566	2.33333333333	LaBute masterfully balances both Traditional or Modern stories together in a manner that one never overwhelms the other. Something for everyone.
2567	1.53333333333	Irwin is so earnest that it's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs. There are far worse messages to teach a young audience, which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy.
2568	1.93333333333	Leigh succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that's simultaneously painful and refreshing.
2569	1.73333333333	Not about scares but a mood in which an ominous, pervasive, and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense.
2570	2.4	'Film aficionados cannot help but love Cinema Paradiso, whether the original version or new Director's Cut.'
2571	2.13333333333	A fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clichés and showcases a group of dedicated artists.
2572	1.06666666667	It's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing   and unprecedented   construction project going on over our heads. It's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process.
2573	1.66666666667	Contradicts everything we've come to expect from movies nowadays. Instead of simply handling conventional material in a conventional way, Secretary takes the most unexpected material and handles it in the most unexpected way.
2574	2.6	Could I have been more geeked when I heard that Apollo 13 was going to be released in IMAX format? In a word: No.
2575	2.46666666667	Murderous Maids has a lot going for it, not least the brilliant performances by Testud ... and Parmentier.
2576	1.06666666667	Filmmaker Stacy Peralta has a flashy editing style that doesn't always jell with Sean Penn's monotone narration, but he respects the material without sentimentalizing it.
2577	1.8	There are a couple of things that elevate ''Glory'' above most of its ilk, most notably the mere presence of Duvall.
2578	1.46666666667	It's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness, and there are moments of jaw droppingly odd behavior    yet I found it weirdly appealing.
2579	1.73333333333	(Rises) above its oh so Hollywood rejiggering and its conventional direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old fashioned escapism.
2580	1.6	A breezy blend of art, history, esoteric musings and philosophy.
2581	2.33333333333	Kids will love its fantasy and adventure, and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor.
2582	-0.4	Tsai Ming liang's ghosts are painfully aware of their not being.
2583	2.2	Leaping from one arresting image to another, Songs from the Second Floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling, amusing and unsettling at the same time.
2584	-0.8	Sean Penn, you owe Nicolas Cage an apology.
2585	1.86666666667	The performances are uniformly good.
2586	1.86666666667	She's all powerful, a voice for a pop cyber culture that feeds on her Bjorkness.
2587	2.06666666667	It's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it.
2588	2.0	For all its plot twists, and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down, Blood Work is a strong, character oriented piece.
2589	2.06666666667	The story line may be 127 years old, but El Crimen del Padre Amaro ... couldn't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the Catholic establishment.
2590	2.4	This in depth study of important developments of the computer industry should make it required viewing in university computer science departments for years to come.
2591	1.66666666667	It shows us a slice of life that's very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable.
2592	1.93333333333	A wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture.
2593	0.733333333333	Has its share of arresting images.
2594	2.33333333333	Leave it to John Sayles to take on developers, the Chamber of Commerce, tourism, historical pageants, and commercialism all in the same movie ... without neglecting character development for even one minute.
2595	3.06666666667	Reign of Fire just might go down as one of the all time great apocalypse movies.
2596	1.4	A smart little indie.
2597	2.6	Payne has created a beautiful canvas, and Nicholson proves once again that he's the best brush in the business.
2598	1.93333333333	Try as you might to resist, if you've got a place in your heart for Smokey Robinson, this movie will worm its way there.
2599	1.8	A riveting profile of law enforcement, and a visceral, nasty journey into an urban Hades.
2600	-1.46666666667	Director Douglas McGrath takes on Nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading.
2601	1.2	Stands as a document of what it felt like to be a New Yorker    or, really, to be a human being    in the weeks after 9/11.
2602	1.93333333333	I am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from TV shows, but Hey Arnold! The Movie is clever, offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance.
2603	1.66666666667	With not a lot of help from the screenplay (proficient, but singularly cursory), (Testud) acts with the feral intensity of the young Bette Davis.
2604	2.66666666667	It's a film that's destined to win a wide summer audience through word of mouth reviews and, not far down the line, to find a place among the studio's animated classics.
2605	1.53333333333	Slow and ponderous, but Rohmer's drama builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion, sacrifice, and Christian love in the face of political corruption.
2606	1.2	If you're not totally weirded  out by the notion of cinema as community therapy spectacle, Quitting hits home with disorienting force.
2607	2.0	Austin Powers for the most part is extremely funny, the first part making up for any flaws that come later.
2608	1.66666666667	While Tattoo borrows heavily from both Seven and The Silence of the Lambs, it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human scale characters that suck the audience in.
2609	1.8	Cho continues her exploration of the outer limits of raunch with considerable brio.
2610	2.6	Elvira fans could hardly ask for more.
2611	0.8	A canny, derivative, wildly gruesome portrait of a London sociopath who's the scariest of sadists.
2612	0.25	The movie should be credited with remembering his victims.
2613	2.7	Fast paced and wonderfully edited, the film is extremely thorough.
2614	1.85	A bracing, unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale.
2615	0.65	Hashiguchi uses the situation to evoke a Japan bustling atop an undercurrent of loneliness and isolation.
2616	-1.4	As if trying to grab a lump of Play Doh, the harder that Liman tries to squeeze his story, the more details slip out between his fingers.
2617	3.3	My Big Fat Greek Wedding is not only the best date movie of the year, it's also a    dare I say it twice    delightfully charming    and totally American, I might add    slice of comedic bliss.
2618	2.25	Few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury, and audience members will leave feeling as shaken as Nesbitt's Cooper looks when the bullets stop flying.
2619	2.25	Another love story in 2002's remarkable procession of sweeping pictures that have reinvigorated the romance genre.
2620	1.45	It's another retelling of Alexandre Dumas' classic. Why? Who knows, but it works under the direction of Kevin Reynolds.
2621	2.9	(F)rom the performances and the cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional narrative, the film is blazingly alive and admirable on many levels.
2622	2.45	Shiri is an action film that delivers on the promise of excitement, but it also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience.
2623	2.6	Provides the kind of 'laugh therapy' I need from movie comedies    offbeat humor, amusing characters, and a happy ending. After seeing 'Analyze That,' I feel better already.
2624	1.9	A penetrating, potent exploration of sanctimony, self awareness, self hatred and self determination.
2625	1.25	This isn't a retooled genre piece, the tale of a guy and his gun, but an amiably idiosyncratic work.
2626	2.3	Overall, it's a very entertaining, thought provoking film with a simple message: God is love.
2627	1.25	It may not be a great piece of filmmaking, but its power comes from its soul's eye view of how well meaning patronizing masked a social injustice, at least as represented by this case.
2628	1.9	Although mainstream American movies tend to exploit the familiar, every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn, to grow, to travel.
2629	2.5	Jeong Hyang Lee's film is deceptively simple, deeply satisfying.
2630	2.15	The film is a hoot, and is just as good, if not better than much of what's on Saturday morning TV especially the pseudo educational stuff we all can't stand.
2631	2.7	George Clooney, in his first directorial effort, presents this utterly ridiculous shaggy dog story as one of the most creative, energetic and original comedies to hit the screen in years.
2632	1.5	Even when it drags, we are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking
2633	1.25	Although commentary on Nachtwey is provided ... it's the image that really tells the tale.
2634	0.2	A life size reenactment of those Jack Chick cartoon tracts that always ended with some hippie getting tossed into the lake of fire.
2635	0.25	Grainy photography mars an otherwise delightful comedy of errors.
2636	0.55	this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers, it's a taunt  a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered.
2637	2.25	The film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer.
2638	2.0	Daily struggles and simple pleasures usurp the preaching message so that, by the time the credits roll across the pat ending, a warm, fuzzy feeling prevails.
2639	0.8	...in no way original, or even all that memorable, but as downtown Saturday matinee brain candy, it doesn't disappoint.
2640	1.95	Clever and unflinching in its comic barbs, Slap Her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up.
2641	0.0	Cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self expression.
2642	-0.933333333333	Sex is one of those films that aims to confuse.
2643	1.46666666667	Compared to his series of spectacular belly flops both on and off the screen, RunTelDat is something of a triumph.
2644	0.8	(Moore's) better at fingering problems than finding solutions. But though he only scratches the surface, at least he provides a strong itch to explore more.
2645	3.06666666667	The powerful success of Read My Lips with such provocative material shows why, after only three films, director/co writer Jacques Audiard, though little known in this country, belongs in the very top rank of French filmmakers.
2646	2.66666666667	In his debut as a director, Washington has a sure hand. His work with actors is particularly impressive.
2647	2.66666666667	A generous, inspiring film that unfolds with grace and humor and gradually becomes a testament to faith.
2648	2.8	Delivers the sexy razzle dazzle that everyone, especially movie musical fans, has been hoping for.
2649	2.0	Vincent Gallo is right at home in this French shocker playing his usual bad boy weirdo role.
2650	2.73333333333	Fierce, glaring and unforgettable.
2651	1.46666666667	Cletis is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer.
2652	1.53333333333	Like its predecessor, it's no classic, but it provides a reasonably attractive holiday contraption, one that families looking for a clean, kid friendly outing should investigate.
2653	2.0	Campanella gets the tone just right    funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful.
2654	1.66666666667	Either a fascinating study of the relationship between mothers and their children or a disturbing story about sociopaths and their marks.
2655	0.466666666667	...gripping and handsome execution, (but) there isn't much about K 19 that's unique or memorable.
2656	2.2	Effective in all its aspects, Margarita Happy Hour represents an auspicious feature debut for Chaiken.
2657	2.46666666667	The delicious trimmings...arrive early and stay late, filling nearly every minute...with a lighthearted glow, some impudent snickers, and a glorious dose of humankind's liberating ability to triumph over a Scrooge or two.

2659	0.933333333333	Not the best Herzog perhaps, but unmistakably Herzog.
2660	2.66666666667	Enjoyably fast moving, hard hitting documentary.
2661	1.33333333333	Rehearsals are frequently more fascinating than the results. Last Dance, whatever its flaws, fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether, in this case, that's true.
2662	-0.133333333333	The film's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled. But ... in trying to capture the novel's deeper intimate resonances, the film has – ironically   distanced us from the characters.

2664	2.33333333333	(Cho's face is) an amazing slapstick instrument, creating a scrapbook of living mug shots.
2665	-1.06666666667	It's about as convincing as any other Arnie musclefest, but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic.
2666	1.8	While not quite a comedy, the film tackles its relatively serious subject with an open mind and considerable good cheer, and is never less than engaging.
2667	2.86666666667	An extremely funny, ultimately heartbreaking look at life in contemporary China.
2668	0.466666666667	Your response to its new sequel, Analyze That, may hinge on what you thought of the first film.
2669	2.4	Davis is funny, charming and quirky in her feature film acting debut as Amy.

2674	1.35294117647	The film is a masterpiece of nuance and characterization, marred only by an inexplicable, utterly distracting blunder at the very end.
2675	2.05882352941	The film is full of charm.
2676	1.76470588235	The movie is well crafted, and well executed. If you're paying attention, the ''big twists'' are pretty easy to guess   but that doesn't make the movie any less entertaining.

2681	2.52941176471	Fathers and sons, and the uneasy bonds between them, rarely have received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film.
2682	-0.411764705882	This sci fi techno sex thriller starts out bizarre and just keeps getting weirder.
2683	2.23529411765	Last Orders nurtures the multi layers of its characters, allowing us to remember that life's ultimately a gamble and last orders are to be embraced. It's affecting, amusing, sad and reflective.
2684	1.35294117647	A slight but sweet film.
2685	1.76470588235	Writer/director Walter Hill is in his hypermasculine element here, once again able to inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that, in many other hands would be completely forgettable.
2686	2.64705882353	It is a happy, heady jumble of thought and storytelling, an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film.
2687	0.647058823529	This new Time Machine is hardly perfect... yet it proves surprisingly serviceable. Even at its worst, it's not half bad.

2693	2.64705882353	Every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices, but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible. That, in itself, is extraordinary.
2694	0.588235294118	If you can tolerate the redneck versus blueblood cliches that the film trades in, Sweet Home Alabama is diverting in the manner of Jeff Foxworthy's stand up act.
2695	1.82352941176	It's a treat watching Shaw, a British stage icon, melting under the heat of Phocion's attentions.
2696	1.35294117647	All in all, an interesting look at the life of the campaign trail press, especially ones that don't really care for the candidate they're forced to follow.
2697	1.88235294118	Narc is a no bull throwback to 1970s action films. It zips along with B movie verve while adding the rich details and go for broke acting that heralds something special.
2698	1.64705882353	Me Without You has a bracing truth that's refreshing after the phoniness of female bonding pictures like Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood.

2700	0.823529411765	Goes a long way on hedonistic gusto.
2701	1.83333333333	The result puts a human face on Derrida, and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible to people who normally couldn't care less.
2702	1.77777777778	The Scorpion King is more fun than Conan the Barbarian.
2703	0.444444444444	If there's one big point to Promises, it's that nothing can change while physical and psychological barriers keep the sides from speaking even one word to each other.
2704	1.72222222222	Unexpected moments of authentically impulsive humor are the hallmark of this bittersweet, uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of...emotional recovery.
2705	1.94444444444	Jacquot has filmed the opera exactly as the libretto directs, ideally capturing the opera's drama and lyricism.
2706	2.33333333333	This is a sincerely crafted picture that deserves to emerge from the traffic jam of holiday movies.

2714	1.77777777778	Ambitious, unsettling psychodrama that takes full, chilling advantage of its rough around the edges, low budget constraints.

2717	1.61111111111	When it's not wallowing in hormonal melodrama, ''Real Women Have Curves'' is a sweet, honest, and enjoyable comedy drama about a young woman who wants many things in life, but fears she'll become her mother before she gets to fulfill her dreams.
2718	0.944444444444	The film runs on a little longer than it needs to    Muccino either doesn't notice when his story ends or just can't tear himself away from the characters    but it's smooth and professional.
2719	1.05555555556	Blithely anachronistic and slyly achronological.
2720	1.38888888889	This starts off with a 1950's Doris Day feel and it gets very ugly, very fast. The first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year!
2721	1.33333333333	Triumph of Love is a very silly movie, but the silliness has a pedigree.
2722	1.33333333333	Discursive but oddly riveting documentary.
2723	1.38888888889	The movie has no respect for laws, political correctness or common decency, but it displays something more important: respect for its flawed, crazy people.
2724	1.16666666667	On its own, Big Trouble could be considered a funny little film.
2725	2.22222222222	An undeniably gorgeous, terminally smitten document of a troubadour, his acolytes, and the triumph of his band.
2726	1.83333333333	This cinema verite speculation on the assassination of John F. Kennedy may have been inspired by Blair Witch, but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative.

2732	0.25	A strong and confident work which works so well for the first 89 minutes, but ends so horrendously confusing in the final two

2734	2.25	Filled with Alexandre Desplat's haunting and sublime music, the movie completely transfixes the audience.
2735	1.9375	As chilling and fascinating as Philippe Mora's modern Hitler study, Snide and Prejudice.
2736	2.375	An hour and a half of joyful solo performance.
2737	2.3125	Strange and beautiful film.
2738	1.5625	No worse a film than Breaking Out, and Breaking Out was utterly charming.
2739	-0.75	Parker cannot sustain the buoyant energy level of the film's city beginnings into its country conclusion
2740	1.3125	'... Despite lagging near the finish line, the movie runs a good race, one that will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches.'
2741	1.4375	...a guiltless film for nice evening out.
2742	1.5	Deflated ending aside, there's much to recommend the film.

2744	3.375	Performances all around are tops, with the two leads delivering Oscar caliber performances.
2745	1.5	Everything about The Quiet American is good, except its timing.
2746	1.5	A savage John Waters like humor that dances on the edge of tastelessness without ever quite falling over.
2747	1.75	At once a testament to the divine calling of education and a demonstration of the painstaking process of imparting knowledge.
2748	1.125	May seriously impair your ability to ever again maintain a straight face while speaking to a highway patrolman.
2749	1.5	It's an interesting effort (particularly for JFK conspiracy nuts), and Barry's cold fish act makes the experience worthwhile.
2750	1.1875	They're just a couple of cops in Copmovieland, these two, but in Narc, they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood.
2751	1.0	Brings awareness to an issue often overlooked    women's depression.
2752	0.25	It's a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5.
2753	1.875	It has a caffeinated, sloppy brilliance, sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care, but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade grubbers to shame.
2754	2.3125	You can almost see Mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing, 'This is going to be something really good.' And it is.
2755	1.875	Foster and Whitaker are especially fine. She is a lioness, protecting her cub, and he a reluctant villain, incapable of controlling his crew.
2756	1.5625	Undoubtedly the scariest movie ever made about tattoos.
2757	1.375	A movie that will wear you out and make you misty even when you don't want to be.
2758	3.0625	Not only better than its predecessor, it may rate as the most magical and most fun family fare of this or any recent holiday season.
2759	1.75	Though the story ... is hackneyed, the characters have a freshness and modesty that transcends their predicament.
2760	2.5625	Although Frailty fits into a classic genre, in its script and execution it is a remarkably original work.
2761	0.888888888889	If this movie leaves you cool, it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative.
2762	0.388888888889	The climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict, just like the movie does
2763	-0.277777777778	A rude black comedy about the catalytic effect a holy fool has upon those around him in the cutthroat world of children's television.
2764	-2.0	All comedy is subversive, but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad.
2765	1.94444444444	If a horror movie's primary goal is to frighten and disturb, then They works spectacularly well...A shiver inducing, nerve rattling ride.
2766	1.16666666667	A playful Iranian parable about openness, particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences.
2767	2.94444444444	Brilliantly written and well acted, Yellow Asphalt is an uncompromising film.
2768	1.16666666667	That 'Alabama' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of Witherspoon (who is always a joy to watch, even when her material is not first rate)...
2769	1.72222222222	Personal Velocity has a no frills docu Dogma plainness, yet Miller lingers on invisible, nearly psychic nuances, leaping into digressions of memory and desire. She boxes these women's souls right open for us.

2775	2.27777777778	The Trials of Henry Kissinger is a remarkable piece of filmmaking ... because you get it.
2776	2.27777777778	Nachtwey clears the cynicism right out of you. He makes you realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty.
2777	1.38888888889	What it lacks in substance it makes up for in heart.
2778	2.05555555556	Robert Harmon's less is more approach delivers real bump in  the night chills    his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film's thick shadows.
2779	1.44444444444	With its hint of an awkward Hitchcockian theme in tact, Harmon's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone
2780	1.88888888889	In Auteil's less dramatic but equally incisive performance, he's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer.
2781	1.38888888889	The heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging, suffering and the prospect of death.
2782	1.27777777778	Will you go ape over this movie? Well, it probably won't have you swinging from the trees hooting it's praises, but it's definitely worth taking a look.

2785	2.94444444444	The Son Of The Bride's humour is born out of an engaging storyline, which also isn't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues. This movie is to be cherished.

2787	2.94444444444	The story's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing, and Mr. Day Lewis roars with leonine power.
2788	2.77777777778	P.T. Anderson understands the grandness of romance and how love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew were possible.
2789	3.27777777778	Twenty years later, E.T. is still a cinematic touchstone.
2790	2.22222222222	This fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality, creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives The Lady and the Duke something of a theatrical air.

2792	-0.0454545454545	This is mostly well constructed fluff, which is all it seems intended to be.
2793	1.5	Even through its flaws, Revolution #9 proves to be a compelling, interestingly told film.

2795	2.81818181818	Schepisi, aided by a cast that seems to include every top notch British actor who did not appear in Gosford Park (as well as one, Ms. Mirren, who did), has succeeded beyond all expectation.
2796	0.409090909091	Watching this film, one is left with the inescapable conclusion that Hitchens' obsession with Kissinger is, at bottom, a sophisticated flower child's desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power.
2797	2.04545454545	There is no denying the power of Polanski's film...
2798	0.818181818182	The movie is amateurish, but it's a minor treat.
2799	1.77272727273	This charming but slight tale has warmth, wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed.

2806	2.27272727273	Even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers, old schoolers and current innovators, Scratch is great fun, full of the kind of energy it's documenting.

2810	1.22727272727	It's hard to fairly judge a film like RINGU when you've seen the remake first. Many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity, (yet) are worthwhile.

2812	2.04545454545	Rarely does such high profile talent serve such literate material.

2826	1.71428571429	It's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self conscious seams in places, but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety.
2827	1.66666666667	What makes Barbershop so likable, with all its flaws, is that it has none of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies.
2828	2.14285714286	Watching these two actors play against each other so intensely, but with restraint, is a treat.

2926	1.52631578947	If you're content with a clever pseudo bio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director's life, Eisenstein delivers.
2927	0.736842105263	This filmed Tosca    not the first, by the way    is a pretty good job, if it's filmed Tosca that you want. I'll stay with the stage versions, however, which bite cleaner, and deeper.

2947	2.10526315789	The new Insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor, and when it does elect to head off in its own direction, it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities.
2948	2.31578947368	A film in a class with Spike Lee's masterful Do The Right Thing.
2949	2.52631578947	Jagger, Stoppard and director Michael Apted ... deliver a riveting and surprisingly romantic ride.
2950	1.68421052632	Greengrass (working from Don Mullan's script) forgoes the larger socio political picture of the situation in Northern Ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation.

2994	1.29411764706	Even these tales of just seven children seem at times too many, although in reality they are not enough. Every child's story is what matters. This film can only point the way    but thank goodness for this signpost.

3026	1.55555555556	A hard look at one man's occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention, a terrifying study of bourgeois desperation worthy of Claude Chabrol.
3027	2.18518518519	(Ramsay) visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art, music and metaphor.
3028	2.14814814815	Frequent flurries of creative belly laughs and genuinely enthusiastic performances...keep the movie slaloming through its hackneyed elements with enjoyable ease.
3029	2.33333333333	At its best, this is grand scale moviemaking for a larger than life figure, an artist who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture.
3030	1.22222222222	The plot of the comeback curlers isn't very interesting actually, but what I like about Men With Brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what's unique and quirky about Canadians.
3031	2.46666666667	10 minutes into the film you'll be white knuckled and unable to look away.
3032	2.66666666667	It's a beautiful film, full of elaborate and twisted characters   and it's also pretty funny.
3033	-0.2	Could this be the first major studio production shot on video tape instead of film?
3034	2.26666666667	Not since Ghostbusters has a film used Manhattan's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way.
3035	2.2	As tricky and satisfying as any of David Mamet's airless cinematic shell games.
3036	3.06666666667	The universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in 'Baran.'
3037	1.26666666667	Cube's charisma and chemistry compensate for corniness and cliche.
3038	1.0	With lesser talents, High Crimes would be entertaining, but forgettable. With Freeman and Judd, I'll at least remember their characters.
3039	2.86666666667	As a director, Paxton is surprisingly brilliant, deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head trip.
3040	2.33333333333	The film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders, but deftly manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill.
3041	1.46666666667	Daughter From Danang sticks with its subjects a little longer and tells a deeper story
3042	1.93333333333	A coming of age film that avoids the cartoonish clichés and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type    the uncertain girl on the brink of womanhood.
3043	0.333333333333	The faithful will enjoy this sometimes wry adaptation of V.S. Naipaul's novel, but newcomers may find themselves stifling a yawn or two during the first hour.
3044	2.8	A distinguished and thoughtful film, marked by acute writing and a host of splendid performances.
3045	1.66666666667	Barry convinces us he's a dangerous, secretly unhinged guy who could easily have killed a president because it made him feel powerful.
3046	2.33333333333	Takes you by the face, strokes your cheeks and coos beseechingly at you: slow down, shake off your tensions and take this picture at its own breezy, distracted rhythms.
3047	1.73333333333	I don't feel the least bit ashamed in admitting that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served, even if it's a dish that's best served cold.
3048	1.6	It's a smart, solid, kinetically charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn. Nothing overly original, mind you, but solidly entertaining.
3049	2.46666666667	Changing Lanes is an anomaly for a Hollywood movie; it's a well written and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say.
3050	2.06666666667	borrows a bit from the classics ''Wait Until Dark'' and ''Extremities'' ... But in terms of its style, the movie is in a class by itself.
3051	1.46666666667	Because Eight Legged Freaks is partly an homage to Them, Tarantula and other low  budget B movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s, the movie is a silly (but not sophomoric) romp through horror and hellish conditions.
3052	1.66666666667	Puts a refreshing and comical spin on the all too familiar saga of the contemporary single woman.
3053	2.6	If you grew up on Scooby    you'll love this movie. Matthew Lillard is born to play Shaggy!
3054	1.73333333333	Though filmed partly in Canada, Paid in Full has clever ways of capturing inner city life during the Reagan years.
3055	2.73333333333	''Spider man is better than any summer blockbuster we had to endure last summer, and hopefully, sets the tone for a summer of good stuff. If you're a comic fan, you can't miss it. If you're not, you'll still have a good time.''
3056	0.8	This movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one, but it's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it.
3057	2.8	The movie is a trove of delights.
3058	2.8	Excellent performances from Jacqueline Bisset and Martha Plimpton grace this deeply touching melodrama.
3059	2.4	In a summer of clones, Harvard Man is something rare and riveting: a wild ride that relies on more than special effects.
3060	1.46666666667	While the humor is recognizably Plympton, he has actually bothered to construct a real story this time.
3061	1.33333333333	Jolting into Charleston rhythms, the story has the sizzle of old news that has finally found the right vent (accurate? Who cares?).
3062	0.916666666667	An overly melodramatic but somewhat insightful French coming of age film ...
3063	1.83333333333	Most thrillers send audiences out talking about specific scary scenes or startling moments; ''Frailty'' leaves us with the terrifying message that the real horror may be waiting for us at home.
3064	1.54166666667	Close enough in spirit to its freewheeling trash cinema roots to be a breath of fresh air.
3065	2.41666666667	Skillfully weaves both the elements of the plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise.
3066	1.83333333333	Damon brings the proper conviction to his role as (Jason Bourne).
3067	2.125	For the most part, it works beautifully as a movie without sacrificing the integrity of the opera.
3068	2.33333333333	As played by Ryan Gosling, Danny is a frighteningly fascinating contradiction.
3069	1.375	This is not Chabrol's best, but even his lesser works outshine the best some directors can offer.
3070	1.375	Despite its flaws, Crazy as Hell marks an encouraging new direction for La Salle.
3071	1.83333333333	You'll end up moved.
3072	1.75	If you ever wondered what it would be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera, this Oscar nominated documentary takes you there.
3073	2.125	The Woodman seems to have directly influenced this girl meets girl love story, but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made Allen's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring.
3074	2.58333333333	I loved the look of this film.
3075	1.875	Those with a modicum of patience will find in these characters' foibles a timeless and unique perspective.
3076	2.25	Beautiful to watch and holds a certain charm.
3077	1.5	13 Conversations may be a bit too enigmatic and overly ambitious to be fully successful, but Sprecher and her screenwriting partner and sister, Karen Sprecher, don't seem ever to run out of ideas.
3078	1.66666666667	The movie is our story as much as it is Schmidt's, no matter if it's viewed as a self reflection or cautionary tale.
3079	1.625	Foster breathes life into a roll that could have otherwise been bland and run of the mill.
3080	2.04166666667	Quitting offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor.
3081	0.291666666667	Some people want the ol' ball and chain and then there are those who just want the Ball and Chain.
3082	1.5	(Barry) gives Assassin a disquieting authority.
3083	2.29166666667	It's refreshing to see a romance this smart.
3084	1.91666666667	At its best (and it does have some very funny sequences) Looking for Leonard reminds you just how comically subversive silence can be.
3085	2.04166666667	As improbable as this premise may seem, Abbass's understated, shining performance offers us the sense that on some elemental level, Lilia deeply wants to break free of her old life.
3086	2.16666666667	Anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but can't afford the $20 million ticket to ride a Russian rocket should catch this IMAX offering.

3088	2.25	Transforms one of (Shakespeare's) deepest tragedies into a smart new comedy.
3089	2.70833333333	An intelligent and deeply felt work about impossible, irrevocable choices and the price of making them.
3090	1.625	It may sound like a mere disease of  the week TV movie, but A Song For Martin is made infinitely more wrenching by the performances of real life spouses Seldahl and Wollter.
3091	0.333333333333	Sayles is making a statement about the inability of dreams and aspirations to carry forward into the next generation.
3092	1.2380952381	As Antonia is assimilated into this newfangled community, the film settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guilty pleasure, daytime drama sort of fashion.
3093	1.2380952381	every once in a while, a movie will come along that turns me into that annoying specimen of humanity that I usually dread encountering the most   The Fanboy
3094	1.42857142857	On its own staggeringly unoriginal terms, this gender bending comedy is generally quite funny.
3095	1.71428571429	It's never dull and always looks good.
3096	0.238095238095	The tonal shifts are jolting, and though Wen's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered, more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive.
3097	2.47619047619	As commander in chief of this film, Bigelow demonstrates a breadth of vision and an attention to detail that propels her into the upper echelons of the directing world.
3098	1.52380952381	With wit and empathy to spare, waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters' striving solipsism.
3099	2.0	All of it works smoothly under the direction of Spielberg, who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely.
3100	1.90476190476	The kind of sweet and sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati.
3101	1.85714285714	With 'Bowling for Columbine,' Michael Moore gives us the perfect starting point for a national conversation about guns, violence, and fear.
3102	1.90476190476	One of the year's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces.
3103	2.52380952381	One of the best inside show biz yarns ever.
3104	0.619047619048	None of his actors stand out, but that's less of a problem here than it would be in another film: Characterization matters less than atmosphere.
3105	2.57142857143	A terrifically entertaining specimen of Spielbergian sci fi.
3106	1.90476190476	A rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd.
3107	-1.66666666667	Solondz is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining.
3108	1.0	Whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini DV, they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car wreck.
3109	1.14285714286	It establishes its ominous mood and tension swiftly, and if the suspense never rises to a higher level, it is nevertheless maintained throughout.
3110	1.28571428571	Although What Time offers Tsai's usual style and themes, it has a more colorful, more playful tone than his other films.
3111	1.47619047619	A moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine.
3112	2.28571428571	A thoroughly engaging, surprisingly touching British comedy.
3113	-0.190476190476	A sloppy, amusing comedy that proceeds from a stunningly unoriginal premise.
3114	1.90476190476	...a rich and intelligent film that uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence and how the heart accomodates practical needs. It is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual
3115	1.09523809524	captures that perverse element of the Kafkaesque where identity, overnight, is robbed and replaced with a persecuted ''other.''
3116	1.90476190476	The actors are simply too good, and the story too intriguing, for technical flaws to get in the way.
3117	1.0	An estrogen opera so intensely feminine that it serves as the antidote (and cannier doppelganger) to Diesel's XXX flex a thon.
3118	2.47619047619	Imamura has said that Warm Water Under a Red Bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women. It may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made.
3119	2.71428571429	It's a ripper of a yarn and I for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill. Naomi Watts is terrific as Rachel; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation.
3120	1.2380952381	A family film that contains some hefty thematic material on time, death, eternity, and what is needed to live a rich and full life.
3121	2.07692307692	With Dickens' words and writer director Douglas McGrath's even toned direction, a ripping good yarn is told.
3122	2.42307692308	Exactly what its title implies: lusty, boisterous and utterly charming.
3123	1.69230769231	The film is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time consuming the illusion of work is than actual work.
3124	2.19230769231	A smart, compelling drama.
3125	2.38461538462	A must see for fans of thoughtful war films and those interested in the sights and sounds of battle.
3126	1.15384615385	I found myself liking the film, though in this case one man's treasure could prove to be another man's garbage.
3127	-0.269230769231	...Rogers's mouth never stops shut about the war between the sexes and how to win the battle.
3128	1.92307692308	Deliberately and skillfully uses ambiguity to suggest possibilities which imbue the theme with added depth and resonance.
3129	0.384615384615	It's all entertaining enough, but don't look for any hefty anti establishment message in what is essentially a whip crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper.
3130	2.46153846154	Nicholson's understated performance is wonderful. As Warren he stumbles in search of all the emotions and life experiences he's neglected over the years.
3131	1.19230769231	Despite its old hat set up and predictable plot, Empire still has enough moments to keep it entertaining.
3132	1.96153846154	Another entertaining romp from Robert Rodriguez.
3133	1.19230769231	It's not a classic spy action or buddy movie, but it's entertaining enough and worth a look.
3134	-1.61538461538	I am more offended by his lack of faith in his audience than by anything on display here.
3135	1.26923076923	A sharp satire of desperation and cinematic deception.
3136	1.42307692308	Tsai convincingly paints a specifically urban sense of disassociation here.
3137	1.38461538462	If you can swallow its absurdities and crudities Lagaan really is enormously good fun.
3138	0.923076923077	An unorthodox little film noir organized crime story that includes one of the strangest love stories you will ever see.
3139	1.88461538462	A pleasing, often funny comedy.
3140	2.15384615385	(A) rare movie that makes us re assess the basis for our lives and evaluate what is truly ours in a world of meaningless activity.
3141	2.96153846154	All three actresses are simply dazzling, particularly Balk, who's finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents.
3142	2.34615384615	An Asian neo realist treasure.
3143	2.65384615385	Plummer steals the show without resorting to camp as Nicholas' wounded and wounding Uncle Ralph. It's a great performance and a reminder of Dickens' grandeur.
3144	-1.26923076923	... less a story than an inexplicable nightmare, right down to the population's shrugging acceptance to each new horror.
3145	-0.807692307692	I am highly amused by the idea that we have come to a point in society where it has been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray Richard Dawson.
3146	2.15384615385	A compassionate, moving portrait of an American (and an America) always reaching for something just outside his grasp.
3147	1.15384615385	An original little film about one young woman's education.
3148	2.03846153846	The film is about the relationships rather than about the outcome. And it sees those relationships, including that between the son and his wife, and the wife and the father, and between the two brothers, with incredible subtlety and acumen.
3149	2.65384615385	One of those terrific documentaries that collect a bunch of people who are enthusiastic about something and then figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm.
3150	2.26923076923	An instance of an old dog not only learning but inventing a remarkable new trick.
3151	0.5	Rodriguez has the chops of a smart aleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid...
3152	0.944444444444	Amy and Matthew have a bit of a phony relationship, but the film works in spite of it.
3153	1.05555555556	Garcia and the other actors help make the wobbly premise work.
3154	1.5	It's surprisingly decent, particularly for a tenth installment in a series.
3155	2.22222222222	A fascinating, unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man.
3156	2.11111111111	It's no accident that The Accidental Spy is a solid action pic that returns the martial arts master to top form.
3157	2.05555555556	Leave it to the French to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller, a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama.
3158	1.11111111111	The director, Mark Pellington, does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister, menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights, a rattling noise, and a bump on the head.
3159	2.5	Heartwarming here relies less on forced air than on Petter Næss' delicate, clever direction ... and a wonderful, imaginative script by Axel Hellstenius.
3160	1.5	Makes the case for a strong education and good teachers being more valuable in the way they help increase an average student's self esteem, and not strictly in the knowledge imparted.
3161	1.88888888889	Steers refreshingly clear of the usual cliches.
3162	2.77777777778	''Home Movie'' is a sweet treasure and something well worth your time.
3163	3.11111111111	Highly recommended viewing for its courage, ideas, technical proficiency and great acting.
3164	2.44444444444	The movie's thesis    elegant technology for the masses    is surprisingly refreshing.
3165	2.77777777778	Scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern Lothario.
3166	2.11111111111	... Wallace is smart to vary the pitch of his movie, balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving War Department telegrams.
3167	2.33333333333	Combines sharp comedy, old fashioned monster movie atmospherics, and genuine heart to create a film that's not merely about kicking undead ***, but also about dealing with regret and, ultimately, finding redemption.

3169	1.83333333333	Marshall puts a suspenseful spin on standard horror flick formula.
3170	1.22222222222	As lively an account as Seinfeld is deadpan.
3171	1.38888888889	Though Lan Yu lacks a sense of dramatic urgency, the film makes up for it with a pleasing verisimilitude.

3174	1.05555555556	But this is not a movie about an inhuman monster; it's about a very human one.
3175	-0.5	At times THE GUYS taps into some powerful emotions, but this kind of material is more effective on stage. It's not a motion picture; it's an utterly static picture.
3176	1.27777777778	What makes it worth watching is Quaid's performance.
3177	1.05555555556	Soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film. What's left is a rich stew of longing.
3178	2.77777777778	It's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts Blue Crush into one of the summer's most pleasurable movies.
3179	2.05555555556	More of the same from Taiwanese auteur Tsai Ming liang, which is good news to anyone who's fallen under the sweet, melancholy spell of this unique director's previous films.
3180	1.16666666667	Hatfield and Hicks make the oddest of couples, and in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world, offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie's political ramifications.
3181	2.32	Best of all is Garcia, who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man.
3182	1.72	The filmmakers try to balance pointed, often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness, with results that are sometimes bracing, sometimes baffling and quite often, and in unexpected ways, touching.
3183	2.24	A sobering and powerful documentary about the most severe kind of personal loss: rejection by one's mother.
3184	0.48	Often overwrought and at times positively irritating, the film turns into an engrossing thriller almost in spite of itself.
3185	2.64	Humorous and heartfelt, Douglas McGrath's version of 'Nicholas Nickleby' left me feeling refreshed and hopeful. Not many movies have that kind of impact on me these days.
3186	2.4	A poignant lyricism runs through Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem.
3187	0.96	This is SO De Palma. If you love him, you'll like it. If you don't...well, skip to another review.
3188	1.16	Rouge is less about a superficial midlife crisis than it is about the need to stay in touch with your own skin, at 18 or 80.
3189	1.08	The moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended.
3190	1.68	Unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling.
3191	2.16	The movie enters a realm where few non porn films venture, and comes across as darkly funny, energetic, and surprisingly gentle.
3192	1.8	Although the subject matter may still be too close to recent national events, the film works   mostly due to its superior cast of characters.
3193	1.04	It's not going to be everyone's bag of popcorn, but it definitely gives you something to chew on.
3194	2.36	Huppert and Girardot give performances of exceptional honesty.

3196	0.6	A cautionary tale about the grandiosity of a college student who sees himself as impervious to a fall.
3197	2.36	An infinitely wittier version of the Home Alone formula.
3198	1.0	Feardotcom's thrills are all cheap, but they mostly work.
3199	2.2	(Hayek) throws herself into this dream Hispanic role with a teeth clenching gusto, she strikes a potent chemistry with Molina and she gradually makes us believe she is Kahlo.
3200	2.08	Mr. Deeds is, as comedy goes, very silly    and in the best way.
3201	0.24	You could love Safe Conduct (Laissez Passer) for being a subtitled French movie that is 170 minutes long. You could hate it for the same reason.

3204	0.8	Broomfield reveals an ironic manifestation of institutionalized slavery that ties a black owned record label with a white empowered police force.
3205	2.32	At just over an hour, Home Movie will leave you wanting more, not to mention leaving you with some laughs and a smile on your face.
3206	1.08	Stuart's poor me persona needs a whole bunch of Snowball's cynicism to cut through the sugar coating. But once the falcon arrives in the skies above Manhattan, the adventure is on red alert.
3207	2.68	There is greatness here.
3208	1.24	Boasts enough funny dialogue and sharp characterizations to be mildly amusing.
3209	2.8	Director Juan Jose Campanella could have turned this into an Argentine retread of ''Iris'' or ''American Beauty,'' but instead pulls a little from each film and creates something more beautiful than either of those films.

3281	1.23529411765	Secretary is not a movie about fetishism. It is a movie about passion.
3282	1.70588235294	Even though it's common knowledge that Park and his founding partner, Yong Kang, lost Kozmo in the end, you can't help but get caught up in the thrill of the company's astonishing growth.
3283	1.41176470588	Although some viewers will not be able to stomach so much tongue in cheek weirdness, those who do will have found a cult favorite to enjoy for a lifetime.
3284	2.11764705882	What could have easily become a cold, calculated exercise in postmodern pastiche winds up a powerful and deeply moving example of melodramatic moviemaking.
3285	2.05882352941	A delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama, this is a movie that tells stories that work    is charming, is moving, is funny and looks professional.
3286	1.23529411765	The IMAX screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation.
3287	1.88235294118	Does an impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war and of filling in the background.
3288	2.0	It's all about Anakin ... and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and, of course, special effect.
3289	-0.176470588235	Lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child's interest and an adult's patience. But it also has many of the things that made the first one charming.
3290	2.76470588235	It's funny, touching, dramatically forceful, and beautifully shot.
3291	2.29411764706	Its rawness and vitality give it considerable punch.
3292	2.35294117647	A live wire film that never loses its ability to shock and amaze.
3293	2.41176470588	The year's greatest adventure, and Jackson's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul    a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate.
3294	1.88235294118	It's fairly solid  not to mention well edited so that it certainly doesn't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark.
3295	2.29411764706	Brims with passion: for words, for its eccentric, accident prone characters, and for the crazy things that keep people going in this crazy life.
3296	1.52941176471	It's secondary to American Psycho but still has claws enough to get inside you and stay there for a couple of hours.
3297	1.94117647059	The Hours, a delicately crafted film, is an impressive achievement in spite of a river of sadness that pours into every frame.
3298	2.05882352941	Fudges fact and fancy with such confidence that we feel as if we're seeing something purer than the real thing.
3299	1.76470588235	This is unusual, food for thought cinema that's as entertaining as it is instructive.
3300	2.11764705882	With an expressive face reminiscent of Gong Li and a vivid personality like Zhang Ziyi's, Dong stakes out the emotional heart of Happy.
3301	1.4	Nohe's documentary about the event is sympathetic without being gullible: He isn't blind to the silliness, but also captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic co operative interaction.
3302	1.26666666667	It may not be as cutting, as witty or as true as back in the glory days of Weekend and Two or Three Things I Know About Her, but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process?
3303	1.93333333333	Secret Ballot is a funny, puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving.
3304	1.06666666667	Although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle aged participants, Dogtown and Z Boys has a compelling story to tell.
3305	0.533333333333	It's got some pretentious eye rolling moments and it didn't entirely grab me, but there's stuff here to like.
3306	1.73333333333	Birthday Girl walks a tricky tightrope between being wickedly funny and just plain wicked.
3307	2.73333333333	The enjoyable Undercover Brother, a zany mix of Saturday Night Live style parody, '70s Blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild, dishes out a ton of laughs that everyone can enjoy.

3309	1.73333333333	Jackson is always watchable.

3311	2.46666666667	A wild ride of a movie that keeps throwing fastballs.
3312	1.93333333333	Confessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from King Hunk.
3313	0.266666666667	Weird, vulgar comedy that's definitely an acquired taste.
3314	0.466666666667	A...cynical and serious look at teenage boys doing what they do best   being teenagers.
3315	1.93333333333	The film is a very good viewing alternative for young women.

3319	2.06666666667	Brave and sweetly rendered love story.
3320	1.66666666667	The film proves unrelentingly grim    and equally engrossing.
3321	2.53333333333	A hallmark film in an increasingly important film industry and worth the look.
3322	1.66666666667	The Last Kiss will probably never achieve the popularity of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, but its provocative central wedding sequence has far more impact.
3323	1.33333333333	If you like blood, guts and crazy beasts stalking men with guns though... you will likely enjoy this monster.
3324	1.93333333333	The difference between Cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited.
3325	0.8	Sad to say    it accurately reflects the rage and alienation that fuels the self destructiveness of many young people.
3326	2.13333333333	There is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye.
3327	2.66666666667	'Anyone with a passion for cinema, and indeed sex, should see it as soon as possible.'
3328	1.4	Seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized, quasi Shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil.
3329	2.13333333333	Mordantly funny and intimately knowing ...
3330	1.93333333333	What makes the movie special is its utter sincerity.
3331	1.93333333333	Fast and funny, an action cartoon that's suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary for the school age crowd.
3332	3.53333333333	One of those rare films that come by once in a while with flawless amounts of acting, direction, story and pace.
3333	3.73333333333	The AAA of action, XXX is a blast of adrenalin, rated EEE for excitement. And Vin Diesel is the man.
3334	2.4	Earnest, unsubtle and Hollywood predictable, Green Dragon is still a deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of Vietnamese.
3335	1.93333333333	An ambitious movie that, like Shiner's organizing of the big fight, pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that don't come off.
3336	1.66666666667	Nair and writer Laura Cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women, emerging with a fine character study that's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life.
3337	2.13333333333	The film's unhurried pace is actually one of its strengths. Entirely appropriately, the tale unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn.
3338	1.8	Despite its floating narrative, this is a remarkably accessible and haunting film.
3339	3.06666666667	Vibrantly colored and beautifully designed, Metropolis is a feast for the eyes.
3340	2.6	Sweetly sexy, funny and touching.
3341	0.0666666666667	...while Dark Water isn't a complete wash (no pun intended), watched side by side with Ringu, it ultimately comes off as a pale successor.

3346	2.0	If you're looking for a smart, nuanced look at de Sade and what might have happened at Picpus, Sade is your film.
3347	1.4	Could have been crisper and punchier, but it's likely to please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies.
3348	1.93333333333	Together writer director Danny Verete's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt.
3349	2.2	Bursting through the constraints of its source, this is one adapted  from television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen.
3350	1.13333333333	Its almost too spectacular coastal setting distracts slightly from an eccentric and good naturedly aimless story.
3351	1.8	In other words, it's just another sports drama/character study. Yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness. Plus, like I already mentioned...it's Robert Duvall! C'mon!
3352	2.13333333333	This story of a determined woman's courage to find her husband in a war zone offers winning performances and some effecting moments.
3353	2.4	Like Shrek, Spirit's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children, because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world.
3354	2.2	A modestly made but profoundly moving documentary.
3355	-0.933333333333	It irritates and saddens me that Martin Lawrence's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2,500 screens while something of Bubba Ho Tep's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere.
3356	1.6	Not everything in this ambitious comic escapade works, but Coppola, along with his sister, Sofia, is a real filmmaker. It must be in the genes.
3357	2.93333333333	The performers are so spot on, it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles.
3358	2.0	This slight premise ... works because of the ideal casting of the masterful British actor Ian Holm as the aged Napoleon.
3359	2.8	Hashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality, suggesting that with his fourth feature    the first to be released in the U.S.    a major director is emerging in world cinema.
3360	1.8	Although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking, the characters make Italian for Beginners worth the journey
3361	1.95652173913	The dragons are the real stars of Reign of Fire and you won't be disappointed.
3362	3.21739130435	Kudos to the most enchanting film of the year.
3363	1.73913043478	It works well enough, since the thrills pop up frequently, and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory.
3364	1.65217391304	Colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you, Burkinabe filmmaker Dani Kouyate's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory.
3365	1.78260869565	It's a powerful though flawed movie, guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming Washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today.
3366	2.13043478261	Director Paul Cox's unorthodox, abstract approach to visualizing Nijinsky's diaries is both stimulating and demanding.
3367	2.30434782609	For 95 often hilarious minutes, (Cho) riffs on the diciness of colonics, on straight versus gay personal ads, on how men would act if they had periods, and on the perils of a certain outré sexual practice.
3368	1.95652173913	Most of the things that made the original Men in Black such a pleasure are still there.
3369	2.13043478261	Mostly honest, this somber picture reveals itself slowly, intelligently, artfully.
3370	0.434782608696	Best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real life events. Those seeking a definitive account of Eisenstein's life would do better elsewhere.
3371	1.91304347826	(Westbrook) makes a wonderful subject for the camera.
3372	1.21739130435	A film that's flawed and brilliant in equal measure.
3373	1.73913043478	Even if Invincible is not quite the career peak that The Pianist is for Roman Polanski, it demonstrates that Werner Herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse, marvelously twisted shapes history has taken.
3374	0.478260869565	Ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to American art house audiences, but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness.
3375	1.95652173913	Hardly a film that comes along every day.
3376	2.47826086957	A wild ride with eight boarders from Venice Beach that was a deserved co winner of the Audience Award for documentaries at the Sundance Film Festival.

3380	1.95652173913	More intimate than spectacular, E.T. is carried less by wow factors than by its funny, moving yarn that holds up well after two decades.
3381	2.0	For once, a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love struck somebodies, but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own.
3382	0.695652173913	If you're burnt out on It's a Wonderful Life marathons and bored with A Christmas Carol, it might just be the movie you're looking for. It depends on how well flatulence gags fit into your holiday concept.
3383	0.913043478261	Moonlight Mile doesn't quite go the distance but the cast is impressive and they all give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy.
3384	1.5652173913	It is an indelible epic American story about two families, one black and one white, facing change in both their inner and outer lives.
3385	1.34782608696	Not as well written as Sexy Beast, not as gloriously flippant as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but stylish and moody and exceptionally well acted.
3386	2.69565217391	Quite simply, a joy to watch and  especially  to listen to.
3387	1.21739130435	A flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds.
3388	1.65217391304	The filmmakers wisely decided to let Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin do what he does best, and fashion a story around him.
3389	3.13043478261	A winning and wildly fascinating work.
3390	-0.173913043478	We do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close.
3391	2.0	Worth catching for Griffiths' warm and winning central performance.
3392	1.18518518519	The tone errs on the shrill side, tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty, grace and a closet full of skeletons.
3393	2.11111111111	An interesting psychological game of cat and mouse, three dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama.
3394	1.96296296296	A meatier deeper beginning and/or ending would have easily tipped this film into the ''A'' range, as is, it's a very very strong ''B+.'' I love the robust middle of this picture.
3395	0.740740740741	The power of Shanghai Ghetto, a documentary by Dana Janklowicz Mann and Amir Mann, rests in the voices of men and women, now in their 70s, who lived there in the 1940s.

3397	1.59259259259	There is a beautiful, aching sadness to it all. Paul Cox needed to show it. It is up to you to decide if you need to see it.
3398	1.07407407407	If Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood suffers from a ploddingly melodramatic structure, it comes to life in the performances.
3399	0.925925925926	If you ignore the cliches and concentrate on City by the Sea's interpersonal drama, it ain't half bad.
3400	2.92592592593	There aren't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny, offbeat and heartwarming (without a thick shmear of the goo, at least), but ''Elling'' manages to do all three quite well, making it one of the year's most enjoyable releases.
3401	1.0	Reign of Fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made    beyond Road Warrior, it owes enormous debts to Aliens and every previous dragon drama    but that barely makes it any less entertaining.
3402	1.55555555556	An earnest, roughshod document, it serves as a workable primer for the region's recent history, and would make a terrific 10th grade learning tool.

3410	0.185185185185	It is a challenging film, if not always a narratively cohesive one.
3411	1.0	Trapped won't score points for political correctness, but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours    a sign of its effectiveness.
3412	1.92592592593	A rock solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense, intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies, plus a heavy dose of father and son dynamics.
3413	2.0	It's incredible the number of stories the Holocaust has generated. Just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians, another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little known perspective.
3414	2.14814814815	As they used to say in the 1950s sci fi movies, Signs is a tribute to Shyamalan's gifts, which are such that we'll keep watching the skies for his next project.

3418	2.88888888889	Kids five and up will be delighted with the fast, funny, and even touching story. Parents may even find that it goes by quickly, because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year, including those intended for adults.
3419	2.59259259259	An unsettling, memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud.
3420	1.51851851852	Maid in Manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road ... But as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans' lofty expectations, the movie passes inspection.
3421	1.61111111111	Much of All About Lily Chou Chou is mesmerizing: some of its plaintiveness could make you weep.

3425	1.44444444444	More than simply a portrait of early extreme sports, this peek into the 1970s skateboard revolution is a skateboard film as social anthropology...
3426	1.61111111111	What I saw, I enjoyed.
3427	1.77777777778	The level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we've long associated with Washington the actor.

3429	2.16666666667	Daringly perceptive, taut, piercing and feisty, Biggie and Tupac is undeniably subversive and involving in its bold presentation.
3430	2.16666666667	Delivers more than its fair share of saucy hilarity.
3431	1.77777777778	A fairly enjoyable mixture of Longest Yard ... and the 1999 Guy Ritchie caper Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.
3432	1.94444444444	Happily, some things are immune to the folly of changing taste and attitude. For proof of that on the cinematic front, look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that Spielberg calls, retrospectively, his most personal work yet.
3433	2.5	Hugely entertaining from start to finish, featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves, it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected Hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels.
3434	0.888888888889	It's not like having a real film of Nijinsky, but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered.
3435	0.777777777778	It's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits. If only it had the story to match.
3436	1.94444444444	Like other great documentaries ... this goes after one truth (the Ford administration's complicity in tearing 'orphans' from their mothers) and stumbles upon others even more compelling.

3439	-0.444444444444	It's quite diverting nonsense.
3440	1.16666666667	An old fashioned scary movie, one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts.
3441	1.27777777778	For all the wit and hoopla, Festival In Cannes offers rare insight into the structure of relationships.
3442	2.44444444444	What makes How I Killed My Father compelling, besides its terrific performances, is Fontaine's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent child relationships without flinching.
3443	1.44444444444	Renner?s face is chillingly unemotive, yet he communicates a great deal in his performance. See it for his performance if nothing else.
3444	2.11111111111	...the kind of entertainment that parents love to have their kids see.
3445	1.77777777778	It's a fine, focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism.
3446	1.83333333333	Its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads.
3447	1.72222222222	Swimming is above all about a young woman's face, and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman's doubts and yearnings, it succeeds.
3448	1.05555555556	A respectable venture on its own terms, lacking the broader vision that has seen certain Trek films ... cross over to a more mainstream audience.
3449	1.77777777778	It's weird, wonderful, and not necessarily for kids.
3450	2.11111111111	An elegant film with often surprising twists and an intermingling of naiveté and sophistication.
3451	2.0	Blessed with two fine, nuanced lead performances.
3452	-0.133333333333	While this has the making of melodrama, the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain, producing a work that's more interested in asking questions than in answering them.
3453	1.0	As a girl meets girl romantic comedy, Kissing Jessica Steinis quirky, charming and often hilarious. Yet it's not quite the genre busting film it's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe.
3454	-1.2	You don't need to know your Ice T's from your Cool J's to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned, something is rotten in the state of California.
3455	2.6	Turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a 'very sneaky' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing/reappearing acts
3456	1.6	Meant for Star Wars fans. It is there to give them a good time.
3457	2.0	From a deceptively simple premise, this deeply moving French drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times.

3459	1.93333333333	Provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the Holocaust.
3460	2.06666666667	Terrific performances, great to look at, and funny. A little uneven to be the cat's meow, but it's good enough to be the purr.
3461	1.93333333333	It's a compelling and horrifying story, and The Laramie Project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does, in fact, still happen in America.
3462	1.86666666667	I like it. There is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude, this fast paced and this insane.
3463	2.33333333333	That rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience    drama, conflict, tears and surprise    that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film.
3464	2.86666666667	That rare movie that works on any number of levels    as a film of magic and whimsy for children, a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death, both pro and con, for adults.
3465	0.333333333333	It's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue, only to be revealed by the dispassionate Gantz brothers as ordinary, pasty lumpen.
3466	2.26666666667	A sharp and quick documentary that is funny and pithy, while illuminating an era of theatrical comedy that, while past, really isn't.
3467	1.73333333333	The film does a solid job of slowly, steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence.

3469	0.533333333333	The directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge
3470	2.46666666667	Overall, Cletis Tout is a winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone.
3471	3.33333333333	Easily one of the best and most exciting movies of the year.
3472	2.26666666667	The script manages the rare trick of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar.
3473	2.26666666667	An engaging, formulaic sports drama that carries a charge of genuine excitement.
3474	3.46666666667	Insomnia is one of the year's best films and Pacino gives one of his most daring, and complicated, performances.
3475	2.66666666667	Like Vardalos and Corbett, who play their roles with vibrant charm, the film, directed by Joel Zwick, is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you can't fake.
3476	2.53333333333	I don't know if Frailty will turn Bill Paxton into an A list director, but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he's made at least one damn fine horror movie.
3477	1.53333333333	Despite its flaws ... Belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn.
3478	0.533333333333	Each punch seen through prison bars, the fights become not so much a struggle of man vs. man as Brother Man vs. The Man.
3479	2.13333333333	The evocative imagery and gentle, lapping rhythms of this film are infectious    it gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear.
3480	3.0	Like the best of Godard's movies ... it is visually ravishing, penetrating, impenetrable.
3481	1.34482758621	Horns and Halos benefits from serendipity but also reminds us of our own responsibility to question what is told as the truth.
3482	1.93103448276	(Has) an immediacy and an intimacy that sucks you in and dares you not to believe it's all true.
3483	2.0	It treats Ana's journey with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film.
3484	2.03448275862	Captivates as it shows excess in business and pleasure, allowing us to find the small, human moments, and leaving off with a grand whimper.
3485	2.31034482759	A refreshingly realistic, affectation free coming of age tale.
3486	1.24137931034	How good this film might be, depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not.

3489	-0.275862068966	To honestly address the flaws inherent in how medical aid is made available to American workers, a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides will be needed.

3493	1.48275862069	Those prone to indignation need not apply; those susceptible to blue hilarity, step right up.
3494	1.51724137931	Like Mike isn't going to make box office money that makes Michael Jordan jealous, but it has some cute moments, funny scenes, and hits the target audience (young Bow Wow fans)   with nothing but net.
3495	2.03448275862	(Dong) makes a valiant effort to understand everyone's point of view, and he does such a good job of it that Family Fundamentals gets you riled up.
3496	1.75862068966	The trick when watching Godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics, savor the pleasure of his sounds and images, and ponder the historical, philosophical, and ethical issues that intersect with them.
3497	2.06896551724	At its best, which occurs often, Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine rekindles the muckraking, soul searching spirit of the 'Are we a sick society?' journalism of the 1960s.
3498	1.51724137931	A modestly surprising movie.
3499	2.20689655172	A headline fresh thriller set among orthodox Jews on the West Bank, Joseph Cedar's Time Of Favor manages not only to find a compelling dramatic means of addressing a complex situation, it does so without compromising that complexity.

3505	2.34482758621	A thoroughly enjoyable, heartfelt coming of age comedy.
3506	1.93103448276	Feeling like a dope has rarely been more fun than it is in Nine Queens.
3507	2.10344827586	Leigh makes these lives count. And he allows a gawky actor like Spall    who could too easily become comic relief in any other film    to reveal his impressively delicate range.
3508	2.72413793103	A lot of fun, with an undeniable energy sparked by two actresses in their 50s working at the peak of their powers.

3510	2.51724137931	What bubbles up out of John C. Walsh's Pipe Dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie they might actually want to watch.
3511	0.0	If Reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum, her tough, funny, rather chaotic show isn't subversive so much as it is nit picky about the hypocrisies of our time.

3513	1.9	Ms. Hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about Zelda's ultimate fate.

3517	2.45	An undeniably moving film to experience, and ultimately that's what makes it worth a recommendation.
3518	1.5	Nicole Kidman evolved from star to superstar some time over the past year, which means that Birthday Girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while.
3519	1.85	Vividly conveys the shadow side of the 30 year friendship between two English women.
3520	0.5	The story has some nice twists but the ending and some of the back story is a little tired. The performances are all solid; it merely lacks originality to make it a great movie.

3525	1.75	A well put together piece of urban satire.

3528	0.35	What doesn't this film have that an impressionable kid couldn't stand to hear?
3529	1.05	What saves it ... and makes it one of the better video game based flicks, is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense, such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist Alice.
3530	2.3	A deeply felt and vividly detailed story about newcomers in a strange new world.
3531	1.5	It's a visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure, as long as you don't try to look too deep into the story

3533	2.1	A full experience, a love story and a murder mystery that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence.

3542	1.53333333333	A bonanza of wacky sight gags, outlandish color schemes, and corny visual puns that can be appreciated equally as an abstract Frank Tashlin comedy and as a playful recapitulation of the artist's career.
3543	1.53333333333	One can't deny its seriousness and quality.
3544	1.93333333333	Good performances and a realistic, non exploitive approach make Paid in Full worth seeing.
3545	1.66666666667	This engrossing, characteristically complex Tom Clancy thriller is shifty in the manner in which it addresses current terrorism anxieties and sidesteps them at the same time.

3771	1.66666666667	... an enjoyably frothy 'date movie'...
3772	2.61904761905	The genius of the work speaks volumes, offering up a hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates.
3773	1.80952380952	Two Weeks Notice has appeal beyond being a Sandra Bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy.
3774	1.47619047619	The movie's seams may show...but Pellington gives ''Mothman'' an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling.
3775	1.61904761905	If Mostly Martha is mostly unsurprising, it's still a sweet, even delectable diversion.

3780	1.09523809524	The sentimental script has problems, but the actors pick up the slack.
3781	1.66666666667	A good documentary can make interesting a subject you thought would leave you cold. A case in point: Doug Pray's Scratch.
3782	1.86666666667	Abderrahmane Sissako's Heremakono (Waiting for Happiness) is an elegiac portrait of a transit city on the West African coast struggling against foreign influences.

3787	2.66666666667	This is one of the rarest kinds of films: a family oriented non Disney film that is actually funny without hitting below the belt.

3793	1.26666666667	Sweet Home Alabama isn't going to win any Academy Awards, but this date night diversion will definitely win some hearts.

3798	1.86666666667	It is a strength of a documentary to disregard available bias, especially as temptingly easy as it would have been with this premise.
3799	1.33333333333	When twentysomething hotsies make movies about their lives, hard driving narcissism is a given, but what a world we'd live in if Argento's Hollywood counterparts ... had this much imagination and nerve.

3823	2.10526315789	A fine, rousing, G rated family film, aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grown ups from squirming in their seats.
3824	1.78947368421	The series' message about making the right choice in the face of tempting alternatives remains prominent, as do the girls' amusing personalities.

3830	0.421052631579	Disappointingly, the characters are too strange and dysfunctional, Tom included, to ever get under the skin, but this is compensated in large part by the off the wall dialogue, visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself.

3839	2.31578947368	That the real Antwone Fisher was able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man is a wonderful thing; that he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle.
3840	0.894736842105	There's not much to Fatale, outside of its stylish surprises... but that's OK.

3845	1.62962962963	Shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept (aliens come to Earth) and infuses it into a rustic, realistic, and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion.
3846	1.7037037037	...the story, like Ravel's Bolero, builds to a crescendo that encompasses many more paths than we started with.
3847	0.703703703704	It's plotless, shapeless    and yet, it must be admitted, not entirely humorless. Indeed, the more outrageous bits achieve a shock you into laughter intensity of almost Dadaist proportions.
3848	1.2962962963	Gondry's direction is adequate ... but what gives Human Nature its unique feel is Kaufman's script.
3849	0.925925925926	The film's plot may be shallow, but you've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots.

3855	1.7037037037	Aniston has at last decisively broken with her Friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil.

3866	1.92592592593	Directed with purpose and finesse by England's Roger Mitchell, who handily makes the move from pleasing, relatively lightweight commercial fare such as Notting Hill to commercial fare with real thematic heft.
3867	1.88888888889	Escapes the precious trappings of most romantic comedies, infusing into the story very real, complicated emotions.
3868	1.62962962963	This big screen caper has a good bark, far from being a bow wow.
3869	1.2962962963	(Allen) manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise.
3870	2.03703703704	I have two words to say about Reign of Fire. Great dragons!

3877	1.86666666667	It's a smart, funny look at an arcane area of popular culture, and if it isn't entirely persuasive, it does give exposure to some talented performers.
3878	1.26666666667	More vaudeville show than well constructed narrative, but on those terms it's inoffensive and actually rather sweet.

3892	2.0	a delightful romantic comedy with plenty of bite. It's far from a frothy piece, and the characters are complex, laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones.
3893	1.2	Using an endearing cast, writer/director Dover Kosashvili takes a slightly dark look at relationships, both sexual and kindred.
3894	2.53333333333	When a movie has stuck around for this long, you know there's something there. It's that good.

3946	2.0	This film is so different from The Apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see Samira Makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility, working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success.
3947	1.1875	Like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to Mr. Wong's In the Mood for Love    very much a Hong Kong movie despite its mainland setting.
3948	0.8125	...a somber film, almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor.
3949	2.0625	Coral Reef Adventure is a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world's endangered reefs    and it lets the pictures do the punching.
3950	2.1875	The overall result is an intelligent, realistic portrayal of testing boundaries.
3951	2.5625	Poignant and moving, A Walk to Remember is an inspirational love story, capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter.
3952	1.5	Worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film.

3955	1.25	While Cherish doesn't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller, it's got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem.
3956	1.3125	In many ways, reminiscent of 1992's Unforgiven which also utilized the scintillating force of its actors to draw out the menace of its sparse dialogue.
3957	1.8125	We admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears, our sympathies.
3958	1.625	An often watchable, though goofy and lurid, blast of a costume drama set in the late 15th century.
3959	2.6875	The entire cast is first rate, especially Sorvino.
3960	1.875	The Cat's Meow marks a return to form for director Peter Bogdanovich ...

3962	2.04347826087	This sensitive, smart, savvy, compelling coming of age drama delves into the passive aggressive psychology of co dependence and the struggle for self esteem.
3963	1.5652173913	The culmination of everyone's efforts is given life when A Selection appears in its final form (in ''Last Dance'').
3964	1.60869565217	In questioning the election process, Payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies, but also the strength and sense of freedom the Iranian people already possess, with or without access to the ballot box.
3965	2.5652173913	A very charming and funny movie.
3966	2.47826086957	This is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography.
3967	1.69565217391	Streamlined to a tight, brisk 85 minute screwball thriller, ''Big Trouble'' is funny, harmless and as substantial as a tub of popcorn with extra butter.
3968	2.73913043478	Consummate actor Barry has done excellent work here.
3969	1.69565217391	The biggest problem with this movie is that it's not nearly long enough.
3970	-0.173913043478	While not all that bad of a movie, it's nowhere near as good as the original.
3971	0.478260869565	Ali's graduation from little screen to big is far less painful than his opening scene encounter with an over amorous terrier.
3972	1.4347826087	I have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture, and, whatever flaws Igby Goes Down may possess, it is undeniably that.
3973	1.60869565217	You can sip your vintage wines and watch your Merchant Ivory productions; I'll settle for a nice cool glass of iced tea and a Jerry Bruckheimer flick any day of the week.
3974	0.608695652174	May be the most undeserving victim of critical overkill since Town and Country.
3975	1.17391304348	A chilly, brooding but quietly resonant psychological study of domestic tension and unhappiness.
3976	1.5652173913	The movie does its best to work us over, with second helpings of love, romance, tragedy, false dawns, real dawns, comic relief, two separate crises during marriage ceremonies, and the lush scenery of the Cotswolds.
3977	1.69565217391	Cold, nervy and memorable.
3978	2.04347826087	Becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the Papin sisters.

3980	1.73913043478	All in all, it's a pretty good execution of a story that's a lot richer than the ones Hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own.

3982	1.52173913043	A pleasant piece of escapist entertainment.
3983	2.04347826087	Among the many pleasures are the lively intelligence of the artists and their perceptiveness about their own situations.

3985	2.17391304348	It's the cute frissons of discovery and humor between Chaplin and Kidman that keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking, but humming.
3986	1.60869565217	The storytelling may be ordinary, but the cast is one of those all star reunions that fans of Gosford Park have come to assume is just another day of Brit cinema.
3987	1.39130434783	There's something about a marching band that gets me where I live.
3988	1.69565217391	Cuaron repeatedly, perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it, giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good time shenanigans in welcome perspective.
3989	1.52173913043	It's definitely an improvement on the first Blade, since it doesn't take itself so deadly seriously.
3990	2.82608695652	A slam bang extravaganza that is all about a wild and woolly, wall to wall good time.
3991	0.526315789474	What's infuriating about Full Frontal is that it's too close to real life to make sense. What's invigorating about it is that it doesn't give a damn.
3992	2.05263157895	Is Red Dragon worthy of a place alongside the other Hannibal movies? As Hannibal would say, yes, 'It's like having an old friend for dinner'.
3993	2.21052631579	Writer director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo makes a feature debut that is fully formed and remarkably assured.
3994	2.36842105263	insightfully written, delicately performed
3995	0.947368421053	Perhaps the grossest movie ever made. Funny, though.
3996	1.63157894737	This 90 minute postmodern voyage was more diverting and thought provoking than I'd expected it to be.
3997	2.36842105263	One of those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us involved.

4000	2.68421052632	Between them, De Niro and Murphy make Showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season.
4001	-0.684210526316	Jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can, but all the bouncing back and forth can't help but become a bit tedious    even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting.
4002	1.57894736842	Filmmakers David Weissman and Bill Weber benefit enormously from the Cockettes' camera craziness    not only did they film performances, but they did the same at home.
4003	1.68421052632	Interesting both as a historical study and as a tragic love story.
4004	2.31578947368	A stylish but steady, and ultimately very satisfying, piece of character driven storytelling.
4005	3.0	It picked me up, swung me around, and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film.
4006	1.94736842105	Graham Greene's novel of colonialism and empire is elevated by Michael Caine's performance as a weary journalist in a changing world.
4007	1.52631578947	Though it's equally solipsistic in tone, the movie has enough vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of Evans' saga of Hollywood excess.
4008	1.84210526316	Compulsively watchable, no matter how degraded things get.
4009	1.89473684211	Delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information.
4010	2.84210526316	Bon appétit! Just like a splendid meal, Red Dragon satisfies – from its ripe recipe, inspiring ingredients, certified cuisine and palatable presentation.
4011	2.21052631579	The structure is simple, but in its own way, Rabbit Proof Fence is a quest story as grand as The Lord of the Rings.

4013	0.631578947368	Some people march to the beat of a different drum, and if you ever wondered what kind of houses those people live in, this documentary takes a look at 5 alternative housing options.
4014	1.94736842105	Playfully profound... and crazier than Michael Jackson on the top floor of a skyscraper nursery surrounded by open windows.
4015	2.84210526316	A film that will enthrall the whole family.
4016	2.05263157895	The charm of the first movie is still there, and the story feels like the logical, unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids.
4017	1.15789473684	K 19 stays afloat as decent drama/action flick

4022	1.64705882353	Nair doesn't use (Monsoon Wedding) to lament the loss of culture. Instead, she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung to traditions.
4023	1.41176470588	Both Grant and Hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people    flawed, assured of the wrong things, and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others.
4024	1.17647058824	Leading a double life in an American film only comes to no good, but not here. Matters play out realistically if not always fairly.
4025	1.23529411765	In the affable Maid in Manhattan, Jennifer Lopez's most aggressive and most sincere attempt to take movies by storm, the diva shrewdly surrounds herself with a company of strictly A list players.

4027	1.23529411765	Though writer/director Bart Freundlich's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent child relationship, it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of Crudup's anchoring performance.

4032	1.88235294118	A film about female friendship that men can embrace and women will talk about for hours.
4033	0.0588235294118	The directing and story are disjointed, flaws that have to be laid squarely on Taylor's doorstep. But the actors make this worth a peek.
4034	1.11764705882	Light the candles, bring out the cake and don't fret about the calories because there's precious little substance in Birthday Girl    it's simply, and surprisingly, a nice, light treat.

4036	1.05882352941	Massoud's story is an epic, but also a tragedy, the record of a tenacious, humane fighter who was also the prisoner (and ultimately the victim) of history.
4037	1.76470588235	If villainous vampires are your cup of blood, Blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest.
4038	1.35294117647	Drumline ably captures the complicated relationships in a marching band.
4039	1.58823529412	Because the film deliberately lacks irony, it has a genuine dramatic impact; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we've somehow never seen before.
4040	0.882352941176	Does point the way for adventurous Indian filmmakers toward a crossover into nonethnic markets.
4041	1.17647058824	Seems based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior, as Happiness was... Hence, Storytelling is far more appealing.
4042	1.94117647059	''Sum'' is Jack Ryan's ''do over.'' Give credit to everyone from Robinson down to the key grip that this bold move works. Especially give credit to Affleck.
4043	2.64705882353	An intelligently made (and beautifully edited) picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it    more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the Hollywood pipeline without a hitch.

4047	1.64705882353	The pain, loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self deprecating, biting and witty feature written by Charlie Kaufman and his twin brother, Donald, and directed by Spike Jonze.
4048	2.64705882353	A gem of a movie.
4049	2.82352941176	Witty, vibrant, and intelligent.

4054	2.85714285714	This is historical filmmaking without the balm of right thinking ideology, either liberal or conservative. Mr. Scorsese's bravery and integrity in advancing this vision can hardly be underestimated.

4056	2.10714285714	It's a hoot watching The Rock chomp on jumbo ants, pull an arrow out of his back, and leap unscathed through raging fire!

4062	2.5	Polanski has found the perfect material with which to address his own World War II experience in his signature style.
4063	2.57142857143	It is life affirming and heartbreaking, sweet without the decay factor, funny and sad.
4064	1.82142857143	An off beat and fanciful film about the human need for monsters to blame for all that is amiss in the world.

4066	2.39285714286	Frei assembles a fascinating profile of a deeply humanistic artist who, in spite of all that he's witnessed, remains surprisingly idealistic, and retains an extraordinary faith in the ability of images to communicate the truth of the world around him.

4074	1.64285714286	One of the film's most effective aspects is its Tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret.
4075	1.25	Solondz creates some effective moments of discomfort for character and viewer alike.
4076	2.10714285714	The film's appeal has a lot to do with the casting of Juliette Binoche as Sand, who brings to the role her pale, dark beauty and characteristic warmth.

4090	2.33333333333	As the princess, Sorvino glides gracefully from male persona to female without missing a beat. Ben Kingsley is truly funny, playing a kind of Ghandi gone bad.

4096	1.33333333333	Talk To Her is not the perfect movie many have made it out to be, but it's still quite worth seeing.
4097	1.73333333333	Beating the Austin Powers films at their own game, this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness.
4098	1.73333333333	This is a dark, gritty, sometimes funny little gem.
4099	1.73333333333	For all its visual panache and compelling supporting characters, the heart of the film rests in the relationship between Sullivan and his son.
4100	1.73333333333	What makes Salton Sea surprisingly engrossing is that Caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that's often handled in fast edit, hopped up fashion.

4106	2.06666666667	Everyone should be able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting.

4109	0.733333333333	The farcical elements seemed too pat and familiar to hold my interest, yet its diverting grim message is a good one.
4110	2.2	Shanghai Ghetto may not be as dramatic as Roman Polanski's The Pianist, but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high.
4111	1.41176470588	Despite these annoyances, the capable Clayburgh and Tambor really do a great job of anchoring the characters in the emotional realities of middle age.
4112	1.52941176471	The underworld urban angst is derivative of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and Goodfellas, but this film speaks for itself.
4113	0.588235294118	The film's heady yet far from impenetrable theory suggests that Russians take comfort in their closed off nationalist reality.

4117	0.941176470588	Merci pour le movie.
4118	1.82352941176	For every cheesy scene, though, there is a really cool bit    the movie's conception of a future world holographic librarian (Orlando Jones) who knows everything and answers all questions, is visually smart, cleverly written, and nicely realized.
4119	1.64705882353	What sets Ms. Birot's film apart from others in the genre is a greater attention to the parents    and particularly the fateful fathers    in the emotional evolution of the two bewitched adolescents.

4121	2.23529411765	Claire is a terrific role for someone like Judd, who really ought to be playing villains.
4122	0.411764705882	It's clear that Mehta simply wanted to update her beloved genre for the thousands of Indians who fancy themselves too sophisticated for the cheese laced spectacles that pack 'em in on the subcontinent.
4123	1.82352941176	Compassionately explores the seemingly irreconcilable situation between conservative Christian parents and their estranged gay and lesbian children.
4124	2.58823529412	The soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission.

4126	1.82352941176	Beneath the film's obvious determination to shock at any cost lies considerable skill and determination, backed by sheer nerve.
4127	2.64705882353	Bielinsky is a filmmaker of impressive talent.
4128	3.0	So beautifully acted and directed, it's clear that Washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him if he so chooses.

4130	1.94117647059	A gentle and engrossing character study.
4131	2.23529411765	It's enough to watch Huppert scheming, with her small, intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain, and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that Chabrol spins.
4132	1.82352941176	An engrossing portrait of uncompromising artists trying to create something original against the backdrop of a corporate music industry that only seems to care about the bottom line.
4133	1.70588235294	A mischievous visual style and oodles of charm make 'Cherish' a very good (but not great) movie.
4134	2.0	Just as the recent Argentine film Son of the Bride reminded us that a feel good movie can still show real heart, Time of Favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain.

4142	3.13333333333	Both lead performances are Oscar size. Quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie, and Moore wonderfully underplays the long suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between Jane Wyman and June Cleaver.

4146	2.4	Davis' candid, archly funny and deeply authentic take on intimate relationships comes to fruition in her sophomore effort.
4147	1.66666666667	It's more enjoyable than I expected, though, and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs. Cinematic pratfalls given a working over. The cast is spot on and the mood is laid back.

4151	2.26666666667	Romantic, riveting and handsomely animated.
4152	1.8	A competent, unpretentious entertainment destined to fill the after school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country.
4153	1.33333333333	Shot largely in small rooms, the film has a gentle, unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic.
4154	1.2	Where Janice Beard falters in its recycled aspects, implausibility, and sags in pace, it rises in its courageousness, and comedic employment.
4155	1.53333333333	Byler is too savvy a filmmaker to let this morph into a typical romantic triangle. Instead, he focuses on the anguish that can develop when one mulls leaving the familiar to traverse uncharted ground.
4156	1.73333333333	McGrath has deftly trimmed Dickens' wonderfully sprawling soap opera, the better to focus on the hero's odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness.

4159	1.2	As directed by Dani Kouyate of Burkina Faso, Sia lacks visual flair. But Kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast, and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie, no matter who runs them.
4160	2.8	The best comedy concert movie I've seen since Cho's previous concert comedy film, I'm the One That I Want, in 2000.
4161	1.73333333333	Broomfield reminds us that beneath the hype, the celebrity, the high life, the conspiracies and the mystery there were once a couple of bright young men    promising, talented, charismatic and tragically doomed.

4171	2.1724137931	The Lady and the Duke is a smart, romantic drama that dares to depict the French Revolution from the aristocrats' perspective.
4172	0.448275862069	Most haunting about ''Fence'' is its conclusion, when we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize, much to our dismay, that this really did happen. Noyce's greatest mistake is thinking that we needed sweeping, dramatic, Hollywood moments to keep us
4173	0.827586206897	World Traveler might not go anywhere new, or arrive anyplace special, but it's certainly an honest attempt to get at something.

4175	1.27586206897	There's absolutely no reason why Blue Crush, a late summer surfer girl entry, should be as entertaining as it is
4176	2.72413793103	An action/thriller of the finest kind, evoking memories of Day of the Jackal, The French Connection, and Heat.
4177	2.86206896552	The best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites.
4178	0.931034482759	In capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever ruminating, genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills, the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st.
4179	0.689655172414	Insomnia does not become one of those rare remakes to eclipse the original, but it doesn't disgrace it, either.

4183	2.06896551724	Nicole Holofcener's Lovely and Amazing, from her own screenplay, jumps to the head of the class of women's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style.

4185	2.0	Has a solid emotional impact.
4186	2.41379310345	Successfully blended satire, high camp and yet another sexual taboo into a really funny movie.
4187	1.06896551724	Mark Pellington's latest pop thriller is as kooky and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in love with myth.
4188	1.93103448276	While maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity, this sad, occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among Wiseman's warmest.

4197	1.31034482759	Watching this film, what we feel isn't mainly suspense or excitement. The dominant feeling is something like nostalgia.

4284	0.130434782609	The story is virtually impossible to follow here, but there's a certain style and wit to the dialogue.
4285	1.73913043478	The music makes a nice album, the food is enticing and Italy beckons us all.
4286	1.0	The film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo, but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking, quietly vulnerable personality of Ms. Ambrose.

4295	1.26666666667	If I have to choose between gorgeous animation and a lame story (like, say, Treasure Planet) or so so animation and an exciting, clever story with a batch of appealing characters, I'll take the latter every time.
4296	1.86666666667	Quiet, adult and just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year... a true study, a film with a questioning heart and mind that isn't afraid to admit it doesn't have all the answers.
4297	1.4	In the end, the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters    damaged goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide.
4298	1.93333333333	Some of the visual flourishes are a little too obvious, but restrained and subtle storytelling, and fine performances make this delicate coming of age tale a treat.
4299	1.4	It is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this.
4300	1.8	The dirty jokes provide the funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen.

4303	2.2	You come away from his film overwhelmed, hopeful and, perhaps paradoxically, illuminated.
4304	1.73333333333	If the material is slight and admittedly manipulative, Jacquot preserves Tosca's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera.
4305	1.06666666667	Thirteen Conversations About One Thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories, and, like a Mobius strip, elliptically loops back to where it began.
4306	2.0	Overall, it's a wacky and inspired little film that works effortlessly at delivering genuine, acerbic laughs.
4307	2.33333333333	A must for fans of British cinema, if only because so many titans of the industry are along for the ride.
4308	1.73333333333	Tsai has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare, unchecked heartache of Yasujiro Ozu.
4309	1.73333333333	Until (the) superfluous...epilogue that leaks suspension of disbelief like a sieve, Die Another Day is as stimulating &amp; heart rate raising as any James Bond thriller.
4310	1.13333333333	It's a good film, but it falls short of its aspiration to be a true 'epic'.
4311	1.66666666667	All the pieces fall together without much surprise, but little moments give it a boost.
4312	2.06666666667	The beauty of Alexander Payne's ode to the Everyman is in the details.
4313	2.33333333333	A touching drama about old age and grief with a tour de force performance by Michel Piccoli.
4314	-0.533333333333	The ending feels at odds with the rest of the film.
4315	1.4	A tone of rueful compassion ... reverberates throughout this film, whose meaning and impact is sadly heightened by current world events.
4316	2.53333333333	A beautiful paean to a time long past.
4317	1.8	Dense and thoughtful and brimming with ideas that are too complex to be rapidly absorbed.
4318	1.8	If you thought Tom Hanks was just an ordinary big screen star, wait until you've seen him eight stories tall.
4319	3.13333333333	With this masterful, flawless film, (Wang) emerges in the front ranks of China's now numerous, world renowned filmmakers.
4320	1.66666666667	Shyamalan offers copious hints along the way    myriad signs, if you will    that beneath the familiar, funny surface is a far bigger, far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to Earth for harvesting purposes.
4321	2.4	This film is an act of spiritual faith    an eloquent, deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion.
4322	1.8	A different kind of love story   one that is dark, disturbing, painful to watch, yet compelling.
4323	2.8	Splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity.
4324	2.46666666667	A compelling, gut clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day.
4325	2.2	She's as rude and profane as ever, always hilarious and, most of the time, absolutely right in her stinging social observations.
4326	0.0	To those who have not read the book, the film is a much better mother daughter tale than last summer's 'Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood,' but that's not saying much.
4327	1.86666666667	Even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene, in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia, it's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon.
4328	1.8	A thoughtful, reverent portrait of what is essentially a subculture, with its own rules regarding love and family, governance and hierarchy.
4329	2.6	It seems impossible that an epic four hour Indian musical about a cricket game could be this good, but it is.
4330	1.6	Will certainly appeal to Asian cult cinema fans and Asiaphiles interested to see what all the fuss is about.
4331	1.93333333333	Touches smartly and wistfully on a number of themes, not least the notion that the marginal members of society ... might benefit from a helping hand and a friendly kick in the pants.
4332	2.73333333333	A wildly entertaining scan of Evans' career.
4333	2.13333333333	A mature, deeply felt fantasy of a director's travel through 300 years of Russian history.
4334	2.33333333333	Boldly engineering a collision between tawdry B movie flamboyance and grandiose spiritual anomie, Rose's film, true to its source material, provides a tenacious demonstration of death as the great equalizer.
4335	1.93333333333	A finely tuned mood piece, a model of menacing atmosphere.
4336	1.4	The Salton Sea has moments of inspired humour, though every scrap is of the darkest variety.
4337	2.66666666667	Both a beautifully made nature film and a tribute to a woman whose passion for this region and its inhabitants still shines in her quiet blue eyes.
4338	1.86666666667	Although shot with little style, Skins is heartfelt and achingly real.
4339	1.93333333333	Harks back to a time when movies had more to do with imagination than market research.
4340	1.8	Upsetting and thought provoking, the film has an odd purity that doesn't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them.
4341	1.2	A very pretty after school special. It's an effort to watch this movie, but it eventually pays off and is effective if you stick with it.
4342	1.46666666667	A harrowing account of a psychological breakdown.
4343	1.2	Continually challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence, of good guys and bad, and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means.
4344	1.33333333333	It certainly won't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time.
4345	2.06666666667	Dog Soldiers doesn't transcend genre    it embraces it, energizes it and takes big bloody chomps out of it.
4346	1.86666666667	At once emotional and richly analytical, the Cosby Seinfeld encounter alone confirms the serious weight behind this superficially loose, larky documentary.
4347	1.66666666667	It may scream low budget, but this charmer has a spirit that cannot be denied.
4348	1.6	'Alice's adventure through the looking glass and into zombie land' is filled with strange and wonderful creatures.
4349	1.26666666667	Without (De Niro), City By The Sea would slip under the waves. He drags it back, single handed.
4350	2.66666666667	A good music documentary, probably one of the best since The Last Waltz.
4351	0.333333333333	If the plot seems a bit on the skinny side, that's because Panic Room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in...and making you sweat.
4352	1.2	...(the film) works, due mostly to the tongue in cheek attitude of the screenplay.
4353	2.53333333333	The film becomes an overwhelming pleasure, and you find yourself rooting for Gai's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other Carmen before her.
4354	0.6	Broomfield has a rather unique approach to documentary. He thinks the film is just as much a document about him as it is about the subject.
4355	1.33333333333	At its best when the guarded, resentful Betty and the manipulative yet needy Margot are front and center.
4356	0.933333333333	Gloriously straight from the vagina.
4357	1.66666666667	It's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery, but otherwise this is the best 'old neighborhood' project since Christopher Walken kinda romanced Cyndi Lauper in The Opportunists.
4358	2.26666666667	The film oozes craft.
4359	2.6	Robinson's web of suspense matches the page turning frenzy that Clancy creates.
4360	3.0	Manages to be both hugely entertaining and uplifting.
4361	3.0	A classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached.
4362	2.0	It's the unsettling images of a war ravaged land that prove more potent and riveting than the unlikely story of Sarah and Harrison.
4363	2.93333333333	a wonderfully warm human drama that remains vividly in memory long after viewing
4364	2.2	Jaunty fun, with its celeb strewn backdrop well used.
4365	1.93333333333	Recoing's fantastic performance doesn't exactly reveal what makes Vincent tick, but perhaps any definitive explanation for it would have felt like a cheat.
4366	1.8	Washington overcomes the script's flaws and envelops the audience in his character's anguish, anger and frustration.
4367	2.33333333333	The film fearlessly gets under the skin of the people involved ... This makes it not only a detailed historical document, but an engaging and moving portrait of a subculture.
4368	2.2	A searing, epic treatment of a nationwide blight that seems to be, horrifyingly, ever on the rise.
4369	2.33333333333	Not a film for the faint of heart or conservative of spirit, but for the rest of us    especially San Francisco lovers    it's a spirited film and a must see.
4370	2.8	Read My Lips is to be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as its lyrical variations on the game of love.
4371	2.2	The color sense of Stuart Little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure, but it would count for very little if the movie weren't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is.
4372	0.0	while (Roman Coppola) scores points for style, he staggers in terms of story.
4373	1.33333333333	Any movie that makes hard work seem heroic deserves a look.
4374	1.6	It may not be a huge cut of above the rest, but I enjoyed Barbershop. It's a funny little movie with clever dialogue and likeable characters.
4375	1.33333333333	A different and emotionally reserved type of survival story    a film less about refracting all of World War II through the specific conditions of one man, and more about that man lost in its midst.
4376	2.66666666667	It's sweet, funny, charming, and completely delightful.
4377	1.6	A perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little Lilo &amp; Stitch had in spades    charisma.
4378	2.53333333333	Beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of Grenoble and Geneva, the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller, until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself.
4379	2.13333333333	Medem may have disrobed most of the cast, leaving their bodies exposed, but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt. That's why Sex and Lucia is so alluring.
4380	2.53333333333	An elegant work, Food of Love is as consistently engaging as it is revealing.
4381	1.625	Although largely a heavy handed indictment of parental failings and the indifference of Spanish social workers and legal system towards child abuse, the film retains ambiguities that make it well worth watching.
4382	0.833333333333	A behind the scenes look at the training and dedication that goes into becoming a world class fencer and the champion that's made a difference to NYC inner city youth.
4383	0.833333333333	A brain twister, less a movie movie than a funny and weird meditation on Hollywood, success, artistic integrity and intellectual bankruptcy.
4384	1.91666666667	A powerful, inflammatory film about religion that dares to question an ancient faith, and about hatred that offers no easy, comfortable resolution.
4385	1.20833333333	In its own floundering way, it gets to you. Just like Igby.
4386	0.666666666667	Return to Never Land may be another shameless attempt by Disney to rake in dough from baby boomer families, but it's not half bad.
4387	1.95833333333	Wise and deadpan humorous.
4388	2.08333333333	God bless Crudup and his aversion to taking the easy Hollywood road and cashing in on his movie star gorgeousness.
4389	1.83333333333	If Signs is a good film, and it is, the essence of a great one is in there somewhere.
4390	0.5	Veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film's nightmare versions of everyday sex in the city misadventures.
4391	0.875	Schrader examines Crane's decline with unblinking candor.
4392	1.83333333333	You can watch, giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you've completely lowered your entertainment standards.
4393	1.41666666667	It thankfully goes easy on the reel/real world dichotomy that (Jaglom) pursued with such enervating determination in Venice/Venice.
4394	2.29166666667	This rich, bittersweet Israeli documentary, about the life of song and dance man Pasach'ke Burstein and his family, transcends ethnic lines.
4395	1.58333333333	Sensitively examines general issues of race and justice among the poor, and specifically raises serious questions about the death penalty and asks what good the execution of a mentally challenged woman could possibly do.
4396	1.16666666667	Cool gadgets and creatures keep this fresh. Not as good as the original, but what is...
4397	2.20833333333	Presents a side of contemporary Chinese life that many outsiders will be surprised to know exists, and does so with an artistry that also smacks of revelation.
4398	2.25	(Jeff's) gorgeous, fluid compositions, underlined by Neil Finn and Edmund McWilliams's melancholy music, are charged with metaphor, but rarely easy, obvious or self indulgent.
4399	3.08333333333	Engages us in constant fits of laughter, until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story, and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched.
4400	2.125	a bilingual charmer, just like the woman who inspired it
4401	2.5	Blisteringly rude, scarily funny, sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys, the film has in Kieran Culkin a pitch perfect Holden.
4402	0.75	The fourth ''Pokemon'' is a diverting  if predictable  adventure suitable for a matinee, with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world's delicate ecological balance.
4403	0.333333333333	What one is left with, even after the most awful acts are committed, is an overwhelming sadness that feels as if it has made its way into your very bloodstream.
4404	0.791666666667	(It) has the feel of a summer popcorn movie. Nothing too deep or substantial. Explosions, jokes, and sexual innuendoes abound.
4405	3.125	Miyazaki's nonstop images are so stunning, and his imagination so vivid, that the only possible complaint you could have about Spirited Away is that there is no rest period, no timeout.
4406	3.16666666667	... a delightfully unpredictable, hilarious comedy with wonderful performances that tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender labels.
4407	3.5	Assured, vital and well wrought, the film is, arguably, the most accomplished work to date from Hong Kong's versatile Stanley Kwan.
4408	2.83333333333	Delia, Greta, and Paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year. As each of them searches for their place in the world, Miller digs into their very minds to find an unblinking, flawed humanity.
4409	2.08333333333	A surprisingly sweet and gentle comedy.
4410	1.79166666667	Shanghai Ghetto, much stranger than any fiction, brings this unknown slice of history affectingly to life.
4411	0.647058823529	It's not particularly well made, but since I found myself howling more than cringing, I'd say the film works.
4412	0.941176470588	But this is Lohman's film. Her performance moves between heartbreak and rebellion as she continually tries to accommodate to fit in and gain the unconditional love she seeks.
4413	1.52941176471	Though its story is only surface deep, the visuals and enveloping sounds of Blue Crush make this surprisingly decent flick worth a summertime look see.
4414	1.64705882353	Ryosuke has created a wry, winning, if languidly paced, meditation on the meaning and value of family.
4415	1.29411764706	Sometimes charming, sometimes infuriating, this Argentinean 'dramedy' succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors.
4416	2.35294117647	You may feel compelled to watch the film twice or pick up a book on the subject.
4417	1.70588235294	Often shocking but ultimately worthwhile exploration of motherhood and desperate mothers.
4418	2.70588235294	A venturesome, beautifully realized psychological mood piece that reveals its first time feature director's understanding of the expressive power of the camera.
4419	1.29411764706	Like The Rugrats movies, The Wild Thornberrys Movie doesn't offer much more than the series, but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome.
4420	1.82352941176	Taken outside the context of the current political climate (see: terrorists are more evil than ever!), The Sum of All Fears is simply a well made and satisfying thriller.
4421	0.882352941176	The setting is so cool that it chills the characters, reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of ''Intacto's'' dangerous and seductively stylish game.
4422	2.64705882353	A lovely and beautifully photographed romance.
4423	3.35294117647	One of the most splendid entertainments to emerge from the French film industry in years.
4424	1.11764705882	Its vision of that awkward age when sex threatens to overwhelm everything else is acute enough to make everyone who has been there squirm with recognition.
4425	2.0	For almost the first two thirds of Martin Scorsese's 168 minute Gangs of New York, I was entranced.
4426	2.23529411765	Open ended and composed of layer upon layer, Talk to Her is a cinephile's feast, an invitation to countless interpretations.
4427	3.11764705882	One of the most slyly exquisite anti adult movies ever made.
4428	1.29411764706	What makes Esther Kahn so demanding is that it progresses in such a low key manner that it risks monotony. But it's worth the concentration.
4429	0.294117647059	Neither the funniest film that Eddie Murphy nor Robert De Niro has ever made, Showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while. Before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon, anyway.
4430	2.05882352941	A clever script and skilled actors bring new energy to the familiar topic of office politics.
4431	2.47058823529	The determination of Pinochet's victims to seek justice, and their often heartbreaking testimony, spoken directly into director Patricio Guzman's camera, pack a powerful emotional wallop.
4432	0.941176470588	Disney aficionados will notice distinct parallels between this story and the 1971 musical ''Bedknobs and Broomsticks,'' which also dealt with British children rediscovering the power of fantasy during wartime.
4433	1.82352941176	It's ... worth the extra effort to see an artist, still committed to growth in his ninth decade, change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is, quite pointedly, about the peril of such efforts.
4434	1.35294117647	Dark and unrepentant, this excursion into the epicenter of percolating mental instability is not easily dismissed or forgotten.
4435	2.23529411765	It's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys, regardless of their ages.
4436	1.76470588235	Boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy, kinky fun.
4437	-1.05882352941	...Myers has turned his franchise into the movie version of an adolescent dirty joke book done up in post Tarantino pop culture riffs...
4438	0.764705882353	If you're down for a silly hack and slash flick, you can do no wrong with Jason X.
4439	1.64705882353	This is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker, but good actors, good poetry and good music help sustain it.
4440	2.29411764706	The modern master of the chase sequence returns with a chase to end all chases
4441	0.705882352941	The messy emotions raging throughout this three hour effort are instantly recognizable, allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time.
4442	-0.764705882353	...either you're willing to go with this claustrophobic concept or you're not.
4443	1.88235294118	Just watch Bettany strut his stuff. You'll know a star when you see one.
4444	-0.882352941176	Austin Powers in Goldmember is a cinematic car wreck, a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride.
4445	0.882352941176	You can fire a torpedo through some of Clancy's holes, and the scripters don't deserve any Oscars. But the nerve raked acting, the crackle of lines, the impressive stagings of hardware, make for some robust and scary entertainment.
4446	-0.882352941176	contrasting the original Ringu with the current Americanized adaptation is akin to comparing The Evil Dead with Evil Dead II
4447	2.35294117647	A small gem of a movie that defies classification and is as thought provoking as it is funny, scary and sad.
4448	1.82352941176	For a long time the film succeeds with its dark, delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them.
4449	2.11764705882	It's the kind of effectively creepy scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just can't take it any more.
4450	2.0	Late Marriage is an in your face family drama and black comedy that is filled with raw emotions conveying despair and love.
4451	0.705882352941	An ambitious and moving but bleak film.
4452	1.35294117647	It's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling, but as an intellectual exercise    an unpleasant debate that's been given the drive of a narrative and that's been acted out    The Believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work.
4453	2.64705882353	It's sweet. It's funny. It wears its heart on the sleeve of its gaudy Hawaiian shirt. And, thanks to the presence of 'the King,' it also rocks.
4454	1.29411764706	It's never laugh out loud funny, but it is frequently amusing.
4455	1.64705882353	A bittersweet film, simple in form but rich with human events.
4456	1.05882352941	The unexplored story opportunities of ''Punch Drunk Love'' may have worked against the maker's minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer/director Anderson.
4457	0.176470588235	''Punch Drunk Love'' is a little like a chocolate milk moustache...
4458	1.23529411765	... digs beyond the usual portrayals of good kids and bad seeds to reveal a more ambivalent set of characters and motivations.
4459	1.88235294118	The beauty of the piece is that it counts heart as important as humor.
4460	2.11764705882	Piercingly affecting...while clearly a manipulative film, emerges as powerful rather than cloying.
4461	1.29411764706	Very amusing, not the usual route in a thriller, and the performances are odd and pixilated and sometimes both.
4462	1.35294117647	While the frequent allusions to gurus and doshas will strike some Westerners as verging on mumbo jumbo ... broad streaks of common sense emerge with unimpeachable clarity.
4463	3.11764705882	The cast is phenomenal, especially the women.
4464	2.94117647059	A marvel of production design.
4465	2.17647058824	The byplay and bickering between the now spy savvy siblings, Carmen (Vega) and Juni (Sabara) Cortez, anchor the film in a very real and amusing give and take.
4466	2.41176470588	Good actors have a radar for juicy roles    there's a plethora of characters in this picture, and not one of them is flat.
4467	2.47058823529	Though in some ways similar to Catherine Breillat's Fat Girl, Rain is the far superior film.
4468	1.94117647059	Is not so much a work of entertainment as it is a unique, well crafted psychological study of grief.
4469	3.0	Remarkable for its excellent storytelling, its economical, compressed characterisations and for its profound humanity, it's an adventure story and history lesson all in one.
4470	3.05882352941	Colorful, energetic and sweetly whimsical...the rare sequel that's better than its predecessor.
4471	1.08	Reno himself can take credit for most of the movie's success. He's one of the few 'cool' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness.
4472	1.92	Significantly better than its 2002 children's movie competition.
4473	1.24	UB equally spoofs and celebrates the more outre aspects of 'black culture' and the dorkier aspects of 'white culture,' even as it points out how inseparable the two are.
4474	1.88	A lot smarter than your average Bond.
4475	2.8	...bright, intelligent, and humanly funny film.
4476	2.44	Painful, horrifying and oppressively tragic, this film should not be missed.
4477	1.44	Part of the film's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz.
4478	0.84	So unique and stubborn and charismatic that you want it to be better and more successful than it is.
4479	1.28	I won't argue with anyone who calls 'Slackers' dumb, insulting, or childish... but I laughed so much that I didn't mind.
4480	0.36	It arrives with an impeccable pedigree, mongrel pep, and almost indecipherable plot complications.
4481	1.96	So fiendishly cunning that even the most jaded cinema audiences will leave the auditorium feeling dizzy, confused, and totally disorientated. Not to mention absolutely refreshed.
4482	2.24	A vibrant, colorful, semimusical rendition.
4483	1.24	The film sometimes flags...but there is enough secondary action to keep things moving along at a brisk, amusing pace.
4484	1.08	It's a drawling, slobbering, lovable run on sentence of a film, a Southern Gothic with the emotional arc of its raw blues soundtrack.
4485	2.04	Nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure.
4486	1.6	It is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags, anatomical humor, or character cliches; it primarily relies on character to tell its story.
4487	2.2	Both a successful adaptation and an enjoyable film in its own right.
4488	0.32	All the filmmakers are asking of us, is to believe in something that is improbable.
4489	1.36	If the very concept makes you nervous ... you'll have an idea of the film's creepy, scary effectiveness.
4490	1.4	Worth a look by those on both sides of the issues, if only for the perspective it offers, one the public rarely sees.
4491	1.76	A mostly believable, refreshingly low key and quietly inspirational little sports drama.

4620	1.86666666667	Vereté has a whip smart sense of narrative bluffs.
4621	1.29411764706	Parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for Ram Dass's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic. But mostly it's a work that, with humor, warmth, and intelligence, captures a life interestingly lived.
4622	0.823529411765	Were it not for a sentimental resolution that explains way more about Cal than does the movie or the character any good, Freundlich's World Traveler might have been one of the more daring and surprising American movies of the year.

4624	1.76470588235	Graphic sex may be what's attracting audiences to Unfaithful, but gripping performances by Lane and Gere are what will keep them awake.
4625	1.23529411765	When compared to the usual, more somber festival entries, Davis' highly personal brand of romantic comedy is a tart, smart breath of fresh air that stands out from the pack even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic.

4629	1.64705882353	What lifts the film high above run of the filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts, as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map.

4648	2.11764705882	A journey spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history, in which we feel that we truly know what makes Holly and Marina tick, and our hearts go out to them as both continue to negotiate their imperfect, love hate relationship.
4649	2.05882352941	The wonderfully lush Morvern Callar is pure punk existentialism, and Ms. Ramsay and her co writer, Liana Dognini, have dramatized the Alan Warner novel, which itself felt like an answer to Irvine Welsh's book Trainspotting.

4671	2.8	Denver should not get the first and last look at one of the most triumphant performances of Vanessa Redgrave's career. It deserves to be seen everywhere.
4672	1.73333333333	You needn't be steeped in '50s sociology, pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of Haynes' work. Though Haynes' style apes films from the period ... its message is not rooted in that decade.

4674	1.46666666667	A gangster movie with the capacity to surprise.
4675	1.2	The film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings, but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission...if ''gory mayhem'' is your idea of a good time.

4857	2.17647058824	Starts slowly, but Adrien Brody – in the title role – helps make the film's conclusion powerful and satisfying.
4858	1.11764705882	Very predictable but still entertaining
4859	3.23529411765	Nothing short of a masterpiece    and a challenging one.
4860	1.76470588235	Pratfalls aside, Barbershop gets its greatest play from the timeless spectacle of people really talking to each other.
4861	0.176470588235	This amiable picture talks tough, but it's all bluster    in the end it's as sweet as Greenfingers ...
4862	1.0	This is one of Mr. Chabrol's subtlest works, but also one of his most uncanny.
4863	1.0	An engrossing Iranian film about two itinerant teachers and some lost and desolate people they encounter in a place where war has savaged the lives and liberties of the poor and the dispossessed.
4864	1.47058823529	Even though we know the outcome, the seesawing of the general's fate in the arguments of competing lawyers has the stomach knotting suspense of a legal thriller, while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy.
4865	1.11764705882	Watching Spirited Away is like watching an Eastern imagination explode.
4866	1.23529411765	As relationships shift, director Robert J. Siegel allows the characters to inhabit their world without cleaving to a narrative arc.
4867	1.64705882353	Twohy knows how to inflate the mundane into the scarifying, and gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record.
4868	1.41176470588	While the story does seem pretty unbelievable at times, it's awfully entertaining to watch.
4869	1.64705882353	A smart and funny, albeit sometimes superficial, cautionary tale of a technology in search of an artist.
4870	1.11764705882	Examines its explosive subject matter as nonjudgmentally as Wiseman's previous studies of inner city high schools, hospitals, courts and welfare centers.
4871	0.294117647059	I prefer Soderbergh's concentration on his two lovers over Tarkovsky's mostly male, mostly patriarchal debating societies.
4872	1.47058823529	'If you are in the mood for an intelligent weepy, it can easily worm its way into your heart.'
4873	2.41176470588	In IMAX in short, it's just as wonderful on the big screen.

4875	1.11764705882	I'm going to give it a marginal thumbs up. I liked it just enough.
4876	1.88235294118	Those of you who don't believe in Santa Claus probably also think that sequels can never capture the magic of the original. Well, this movie proves you wrong on both counts.
4877	1.88235294118	A deliciously nonsensical comedy about a city coming apart at its seams.
4878	2.11764705882	The rare Imax movie that you'll wish was longer than an hour.
4879	0.588235294118	My Wife's plotting is nothing special; it's the delivery that matters here.
4880	1.0	I've yet to find an actual Vietnam War combat movie actually produced by either the North or South Vietnamese, but at least now we've got something pretty damn close.
4881	1.82352941176	A moving and not infrequently breathtaking film.
4882	1.05882352941	It's a sharp movie about otherwise dull subjects.
4883	0.235294117647	It's like Rocky and Bullwinkle on Speed, but that's neither completely enlightening, nor does it catch the intensity of the movie's strangeness.
4884	2.11764705882	As action adventure, this space based homage to Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island fires on all plasma conduits.
4885	0.823529411765	A melancholy, emotional film.
4886	0.823529411765	While the filmmaking may be a bit disjointed, the subject matter is so fascinating that you won't care.
4887	2.17647058824	Intensely romantic, thought provoking and even an engaging mystery.
4888	2.70588235294	Goofy, nutty, consistently funny. And educational!
4889	0.529411764706	Another in a long line of ultra violent war movies, this one is not quite what it could have been as a film, but the story and theme make up for it.
4890	2.41176470588	It leaves little doubt that Kidman has become one of our best actors.
4891	2.25	The film boasts dry humor and jarring shocks, plus moments of breathtaking mystery.
4892	2.75	Beautifully directed and convincingly acted.
4893	1.6875	Gambling and throwing a basketball game for money isn't a new plot    in fact Toback himself used it in Black and White. But Toback's deranged immediacy makes it seem fresh again.
4894	2.4375	In the director's cut, the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush, all enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes.
4895	2.375	Bring on the sequel.
4896	1.875	Graced with the kind of social texture and realism that would be foreign in American teen comedies.
4897	1.4375	If we sometimes need comforting fantasies about mental illness, we also need movies like Tim McCann's Revolution No. 9.
4898	1.1875	The film occasionally tries the viewer's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy, but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story.
4899	2.625	A big budget/all star movie as unblinkingly pure as The Hours is a distinct rarity, and an event.
4900	0.375	... certainly an entertaining ride, despite many talky, slow scenes. But something seems to be missing. A sense of real magic, perhaps.
4901	2.625	That Haynes can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace.

4903	2.75	...one of the most entertaining monster movies in ages...

4905	0.0625	Would you laugh if a tuba playing dwarf rolled down a hill in a trash can? Do you chuckle at the thought of an ancient librarian whacking a certain part of a man's body? If you answered yes, by all means enjoy The New Guy.
4906	1.4375	The film is ... determined to treat its characters, weak and strong, as fallible human beings, not caricatures, and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self preservation.
4907	-0.875	Missteps take what was otherwise a fascinating, riveting story and send it down the path of the mundane.
4908	1.9375	An indispensable peek at the art and the agony of making people laugh.
4909	1.25	Steadfastly uncinematic but powerfully dramatic.
4910	1.1875	The engagingly primitive animated special effects contribute to a mood that's sustained through the surprisingly somber conclusion.
4911	1.0625	Made Up lampoons the moviemaking process itself, while shining a not particularly flattering spotlight on America's skin deep notions of pulchritude.
4912	1.875	Evokes the 19th century with a subtlety that is an object lesson in period filmmaking.
4913	1.3125	Ya Yas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film.
4914	1.875	The film's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political Blair Witch, a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen.
4915	2.8125	The artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from Japan, the characters move with grace and panache.
4916	1.75	The picture's fascinating byways are littered with trenchant satirical jabs at the peculiar egocentricities of the acting breed.
4917	-1.0	The modern remake of Dumas's story is long on narrative and (too) short on action.
4918	0.75	Fred Schepisi's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen. With a cast of A list Brit actors, it is worth searching out.
4919	-1.0	Suffers from its timid parsing of the barn side target of sons trying to breach gaps in their relationships with their fathers.
4920	2.875	Nonchalantly freaky and uncommonly pleasurable, Warm Water may well be the year's best and most unpredictable comedy.
4921	0.473684210526	It's like an old Warner Bros. costumer jived with sex    this could be the movie Errol Flynn always wanted to make, though Bette Davis, cast as Joan, would have killed him.

4924	2.10526315789	Oh, James! Your 20th outing shows off a lot of stamina and vitality, and get this, Madonna's cameo doesn't suck!
4925	1.42105263158	That death is merely a transition is a common tenet in the world's religions. This deeply spiritual film taps into the meaning and consolation in afterlife communications.
4926	2.26315789474	There is something that is so meditative and lyrical about Babak Payami's boldly quirky Iranian drama Secret Ballot...a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of Middle Eastern world politics
4927	2.68421052632	A huge box office hit in Korea, Shiri is a must for genre fans.
4928	2.26315789474	I'm not a fan of the phrase 'life affirming' because it usually means 'schmaltzy,' but Real Women Have Curves truly is life affirming.

4930	2.26315789474	If it's unnerving suspense you're after    you'll find it with Ring, an indisputably spooky film; with a screenplay to die for.
4931	2.84210526316	The art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed, and Kurys' direction is clever and insightful.
4932	0.0	Red Dragon makes one appreciate Silence of the Lambs.

4935	1.57894736842	While Broomfield's film doesn't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip hop culture, it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system.

4937	2.52631578947	Laugh out loud lines, adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances, and sparkling, bittersweet dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl's dilemma.
4938	1.47368421053	Tends to pile too many ''serious issues'' on its plate at times, yet remains fairly light, always entertaining, and smartly written.
4939	2.10526315789	A solidly entertaining little film.
4940	2.52631578947	It's an entertaining movie, and the effects, boosted to the size of a downtown hotel, will all but take you to outer space.
4941	2.21052631579	Sayles has a knack for casting, often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now ... and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors.
4942	1.42105263158	Despite an overwrought ending, the film works as well as it does because of the performances.
4943	2.21052631579	A passionately inquisitive film determined to uncover the truth and hopefully inspire action.
4944	1.63157894737	Though Nijinsky's words grow increasingly disturbed, the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non narrative feature.
4945	2.05263157895	A muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any Scorsese has ever given us.
4946	2.31578947368	From both a great and a terrible story, Mr. Nelson has made a film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience.
4947	0.315789473684	Spider Man is about growing strange hairs, getting a more mature body, and finding it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units.
4948	1.57894736842	The first shocking thing about Sorority Boys is that it's actually watchable. Even more baffling is that it's funny.
4949	1.78947368421	Highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast, it's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring Ice T in a major role.
4950	1.63157894737	Neither quite a comedy nor a romance, more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest Attal and Gainsbourg    they live together    the film has a lot of charm.
4951	2.61111111111	First and foremost...the reason to go see ''Blue Crush'' is the phenomenal, water born cinematography by David Hennings.
4952	1.27777777778	A visionary marvel, but it's lacking a depth in storytelling usually found in anime like this.
4953	2.77777777778	The problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving, and the film itself    as well its delightful cast    is so breezy, pretty and gifted, it really won my heart.
4954	1.83333333333	In his latest effort, Storytelling, Solondz has finally made a movie that isn't just offensive    it also happens to be good.
4955	2.38888888889	How I Killed My Father would be a rarity in Hollywood. It's an actor's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects, but rather by emphasizing the characters    including the supporting ones.
4956	-1.0	I just saw this movie... well, it's probably not accurate to call it a movie.
4957	1.72222222222	What's most memorable about Circuit is that it's shot on digital video, whose tiny camera enables Shafer to navigate spaces both large ... and small ... with considerable aplomb.
4958	2.77777777778	Scherfig, the writer director, has made a film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar. Yes, soar.
4959	2.11111111111	A delicious and delicately funny look at the residents of a Copenhagen neighborhood coping with the befuddling complications life tosses at them.
4960	-0.111111111111	''What really happened?'' is a question for philosophers, not filmmakers; all the filmmakers need to do is engage an audience.
4961	1.5	Soderbergh, like Kubrick before him, may not touch the planet's skin, but understands the workings of its spirit.
4962	2.77777777778	Much credit must be given to the water camera operating team of Don King, Sonny Miller, and Michael Stewart. Their work is fantastic.
4963	1.33333333333	Crush is so warm and fuzzy you might be able to forgive its mean spirited second half.
4964	-0.111111111111	Franco is an excellent choice for the walled off but combustible hustler, but he does not give the transcendent performance SONNY needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic.
4965	1.66666666667	Tsai Ming liang's witty, wistful new film, What Time Is It There?, is a temporal inquiry that shoulders its philosophical burden lightly.
4966	1.5	The Pianist lacks the quick emotional connections of Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List. But Mr. Polanski creates images even more haunting than those in Mr. Spielberg's 1993 classic.
4967	3.11111111111	Steers, in his feature film debut, has created a brilliant motion picture.
4968	2.88888888889	A brilliant, absurd collection of vignettes that, in their own idiosyncratic way, sum up the strange horror of life in the new millennium.
4969	2.61111111111	As warm as it is wise, deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer, providing an experience that is richer than anticipated.
4970	1.33333333333	The film may not hit as hard as some of the better drug related pictures, but it still manages to get a few punches in.
4971	1.77777777778	Old fashioned but thoroughly satisfying entertainment.
4972	2.44444444444	An energizing, intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip hop culture in general and the art of scratching (or turntablism) in particular.
4973	2.44444444444	A fun family movie that's suitable for all ages    a movie that will make you laugh, cry and realize, 'It's never too late to believe in your dreams.'
4974	1.83333333333	If you open yourself up to Mr. Reggio's theory of this imagery as the movie's set ... it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change.
4975	2.27777777778	I had a dream that a smart comedy would come along to rescue me from a summer of teen driven, toilet humor codswallop, and its name was Earnest.
4976	1.38888888889	Even though the film doesn't manage to hit all of its marks, it's still entertaining to watch the target practice.
4977	0.0	Where This was lazy but enjoyable, a formula comedy redeemed by its stars, That is even lazier and far less enjoyable.
4978	2.72222222222	The 3 D vistas from orbit, with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe, are stanzas of breathtaking, awe inspiring visual poetry.
4979	1.83333333333	The attraction between these two marginal characters is complex from the start    and, refreshingly, stays that way.
4980	2.44444444444	Fans of the modern day Hong Kong action film finally have the worthy successor to A Better Tomorrow and The Killer which they have been patiently waiting for.
4981	1.46666666667	Even when he's not at his most critically insightful, Godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work.
4982	1.26666666667	What sets this romantic comedy apart from most Hollywood romantic comedies is its low key way of tackling what seems like done to death material.
4983	1.33333333333	Has enough wit, energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side, but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they're not interested.
4984	2.13333333333	This seductive tease of a thriller gets the job done. It's a scorcher.
4985	2.13333333333	Bittersweet comedy/drama full of life, hand gestures, and some really adorable Italian guys.
4986	2.2	Works as pretty contagious fun.
4987	2.2	The best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism, and Bertrand Tavernier's oft brilliant Safe Conduct (''Laissez passer'') wears its heart on its sleeve.
4988	1.86666666667	A realistically terrifying movie that puts another notch in the belt of the long list of renegade cop tales.
4989	2.06666666667	A charming, banter filled comedy... one of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims    and by extension, accomplishments    seem deceptively slight on the surface.
4990	2.66666666667	A film with almost as many delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers.
4991	2.4	Serious movie goers embarking upon this journey will find that The Road to Perdition leads to a satisfying destination.
4992	2.0	Heartwarming and gently comic even as the film breaks your heart.
4993	1.46666666667	Caruso sometimes descends into sub Tarantino cuteness ... but for the most part he makes sure The Salton Sea works the way a good noir should, keeping it tight and nasty.
4994	0.933333333333	A ''black Austin Powers?'' I prefer to think of it as ''Pootie Tang with a budget.'' Sa da TAY!
4995	1.86666666667	Oddly, the film isn't nearly as downbeat as it sounds, but strikes a tone that's alternately melancholic, hopeful and strangely funny.
4996	1.33333333333	I would be shocked if there was actually one correct interpretation, but that shouldn't make the movie or the discussion any less enjoyable.
4997	1.13333333333	Chouraqui brings documentary like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of 'ethnic cleansing.'
4998	1.66666666667	The best thing I can say about this film is that I can't wait to see what the director does next.

5000	2.4	One of the funnier movies in town.
5001	1.8	Campanella's competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over Rafael's evolution.
5002	2.53333333333	By turns very dark and very funny.

5005	2.26666666667	Simultaneously heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely sad.
5006	1.4	Though overall an overwhelmingly positive portrayal, the film doesn't ignore the more problematic aspects of Brown's life.
5007	2.0	The philosophical musings of the dialogue jar against the tawdry soap opera antics of the film's action in a way that is surprisingly enjoyable.
5008	2.0	Not too fancy, not too filling, not too fluffy, but definitely tasty and sweet.
5009	2.33333333333	Director Lee has a true cinematic knack, but it's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly, unabashedly on its sleeve.
5010	1.2	As Allen's execution date closes in, the documentary gives an especially poignant portrait of her friendship with the never flagging legal investigator David Presson.

5012	2.85	A vivid, spicy footnote to history, and a movie that grips and holds you in rapt attention from start to finish.
5013	1.9	If S&amp;M seems like a strange route to true love, maybe it is, but it's to this film's (and its makers') credit that we believe that that's exactly what these two people need to find each other    and themselves.
5014	1.4	If the film's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying, its through line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start.
5015	2.2	One of the best of a growing strain of daring films ... that argue that any sexual relationship that doesn't hurt anyone and works for its participants is a relationship that is worthy of our respect.
5016	2.4	...an adorably whimsical comedy that deserves more than a passing twinkle.
5017	2.6	An engrossing story that combines psychological drama, sociological reflection, and high octane thriller.
5018	2.1	It's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs, but Westbrook's foundation and Dalrymple's film earn their uplift.
5019	1.5	Mel Gibson fights the good fight in Vietnam in director Randall Wallace's flag waving war flick with a core of decency.
5020	2.2	There's real visual charge to the filmmaking, and a strong erotic spark to the most crucial lip reading sequence.
5021	2.35	A brutal and funny work. Nicole Holofcenter, the insightful writer/director responsible for this illuminating comedy doesn't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully.
5022	0.4	The film is a blunt indictment, part of a perhaps surreal campaign to bring Kissinger to trial for crimes against humanity.

5025	0.55	The kind of trifle that date nights were invented for.
5026	1.9	. It's a testament to the film's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining, despite playing out like a feature length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries. There's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls...
5027	0.5	Tells (the story) with such atmospheric ballast that shrugging off the plot's persnickety problems is simply a matter of (being) in a shrugging mood.
5028	1.5	The film is hard to dismiss    moody, thoughtful, and lit by flashes of mordant humor.
5029	1.55	If The Man from Elysian Fields is doomed by its smallness, it is also elevated by it  the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you're one of the lucky few who sought it out.
5030	1.85	What emerges is an unsettling picture of childhood innocence combined with indoctrinated prejudice. Promises is a compelling piece that demonstrates just how well children can be trained to live out and carry on their parents' anguish.
5031	1.2	Meticulously uncovers a trail of outrageous force and craven concealment.
5032	1.35	Hey, Happy! is many things    stoner midnight flick, sci fi deconstruction, gay fantasia    but above all it's a love story as sanguine as its title.

5034	1.5	At its best ... Festival in Cannes bubbles with the excitement of the festival in Cannes.

5040	1.4	Wonder of wonders    a teen movie with a humanistic message.

5050	1.6875	Other than the slightly flawed (and fairly unbelievable) finale, everything else is top shelf.
5051	2.375	This fascinating look at Israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from Gaza and, because of its heightened, well shaped dramas, twice as powerful.

5067	1.3125	A penetrating glimpse into the tissue thin ego of the stand up comic.

5075	-0.210526315789	The script's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis, but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off.
5076	0.947368421053	Maggie Smith as the Ya Ya member with the O2 tank will absolutely crack you up with her crass, then gasp for gas, verbal deportment.
5077	2.68421052632	This is a movie that refreshes the mind and spirit along with the body, so original is its content, look, and style.
5078	-0.210526315789	Although I didn't hate this one, it's not very good either. It can be safely recommended as a video/DVD babysitter.

5080	2.63157894737	The film has the high buffed gloss and high octane jolts you expect of De Palma, but what makes it transporting is that it's also one of the smartest, most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an American director in years.

5082	2.36842105263	Max pokes, provokes, takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve...as far as art is concerned, it's mission accomplished.

5099	2.15789473684	All in all, Brown Sugar is a satisfying well made romantic comedy that's both charming and well acted. It will guarantee to have you leaving the theater with a smile on your face.

5106	2.28571428571	A fresh, entertaining comedy that looks at relationships minus traditional gender roles.
5107	1.57142857143	Although Estela Bravo's documentary is cloyingly hagiographic in its portrait of Cuban leader Fidel Castro, it's still a guilty pleasure to watch.
5108	2.7619047619	Surprisingly, the film is a hilarious adventure and I shamelessly enjoyed it.
5109	1.95238095238	The Way Home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all, a condition only the old are privy to, and...often misconstrued as weakness.
5110	2.61904761905	Brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy, which makes its message resonate.
5111	1.57142857143	If you can read the subtitles (the opera is sung in Italian) and you like 'Masterpiece Theatre' type costumes, you'll enjoy this movie.
5112	2.19047619048	A pretty funny movie, with most of the humor coming, as before, from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of Crystal and De Niro.
5113	2.04761904762	Gangster No. 1 is solid, satisfying fare for adults.
5114	3.33333333333	This Chicago has hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit, as well as one terrific score and attitude to spare.

5118	1.33333333333	Insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang bang, shoot em up scene at the conclusion. But the performances of Pacino, Williams, and Swank keep the viewer wide awake all the way through.
5119	1.38095238095	What might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising, subtle turn at the midway point.

5122	1.09523809524	This is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action, cheese, ham and cheek (as well as a serious debt to The Road Warrior), but it feels like unrealized potential
5123	1.95238095238	It's a testament to De Niro and director Michael Caton Jones that by movie's end, we accept the characters and the film, flaws and all.
5124	2.33333333333	Performances are potent, and the women's stories are ably intercut and involving.
5125	3.19047619048	An enormously entertaining movie, like nothing we've ever seen before, and yet completely familiar.
5126	2.47619047619	Lan Yu is a genuine love story, full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery.
5127	1.09523809524	Your children will be occupied for 72 minutes.

5132	2.39285714286	Passion, melodrama, sorrow, laugther, and tears cascade over the screen effortlessly...
5133	1.10714285714	Road to Perdition does display greatness, and it's worth seeing. But it also comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it's won.
5134	2.5	A marvelous performance by Allison Lohman as an identity seeking foster child.
5135	1.89285714286	Arliss Howard's ambitious, moving, and adventurous directorial debut, Big Bad Love, meets so many of the challenges it poses for itself that one can forgive the film its flaws.
5136	1.92857142857	Critics need a good laugh, too, and this too extreme for TV rendition of the notorious MTV show delivers the outrageous, sickening, sidesplitting goods in steaming, visceral heaps.
5137	1.39285714286	What a dumb, fun, curiously adolescent movie this is.
5138	1.21428571429	The charms of the lead performances allow us to forget most of the film's problems.
5139	1.75	A vivid, sometimes surreal, glimpse into the mysteries of human behavior.
5140	2.96428571429	A tour de force of modern cinema.
5141	2.64285714286	Peralta captures, in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago, the essence of the Dogtown experience.
5142	2.07142857143	The lively appeal of The Last Kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta fagioli comedy.
5143	2.25	Without resorting to camp or parody, Haynes (like Sirk, but differently) has transformed the rhetoric of Hollywood melodrama into something provocative, rich, and strange.
5144	3.03571428571	The performances are an absolute joy.
5145	1.07142857143	A quasi documentary by French filmmaker Karim Dridi that celebrates the hardy spirit of Cuban music.
5146	2.53571428571	Grant carries the day with impeccable comic timing, raffish charm and piercing intellect.
5147	1.89285714286	A sensitive and astute first feature by Anne Sophie Birot.
5148	3.07142857143	Both exuberantly romantic and serenely melancholy, What Time Is It There? may prove to be (Tsai's) masterpiece.

5150	2.64285714286	Standing in the Shadows of Motown is the best kind of documentary, one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand new tomorrow.
5151	2.14285714286	It's nice to see Piscopo again after all these years, and Chaykin and Headly are priceless.
5152	1.39285714286	Provides a porthole into that noble, trembling incoherence that defines us all.
5153	-1.42857142857	Simplistic, silly and tedious.
5154	-2.07142857143	It's so laddish and juvenile, only teenage boys could possibly find it funny.
5155	-2.39285714286	Exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable.
5156	-1.17857142857	(Garbus) discards the potential for pathological study, exhuming instead, the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation.
5157	-1.03571428571	A visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification.
5158	-2.46428571429	The story is also as unoriginal as they come, already having been recycled more times than I'd care to count.
5159	-2.21428571429	About the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado    to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time.
5160	-2.03571428571	Not so much farcical as sour.
5161	-2.3	Unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script.
5162	-1.3	All the more disquieting for its relatively gore free allusions to the serial murders, but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject.
5163	-2.35	A sentimental mess that never rings true.
5164	-0.9	While the performances are often engaging, this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one hour TV documentary.
5165	-0.45	Interesting, but not compelling.
5166	-2.25	On a cutting room floor somewhere lies...footage that might have made No Such Thing a trenchant, ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire.
5167	-1.6	While the ensemble player who gained notice in Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch has the bod, he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle.
5168	-2.1	There is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid
5169	-1.85	Nothing here seems as funny as it did in Analyze This, not even Joe Viterelli as De Niro's right hand goombah.
5170	-1.5	Such master screenwriting comes courtesy of John Pogue, the Yale grad who previously gave us ''The Skulls'' and last year's ''Rollerball.'' Enough said, except: Film overboard!
5171	-1.85	Here, common sense flies out the window, along with the hail of bullets, none of which ever seem to hit Sascha.
5172	-2.5	This 100 minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material.
5173	-1.95	The execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that Rob Schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl.
5174	-2.35	On its own, it's not very interesting. As a remake, it's a pale imitation.
5175	-2.95	It shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl on girl action.
5176	-1.75	A farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise, it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films.
5177	-2.6	As exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical Pax viewer, the rest of us will be lulled into a coma.
5178	-1.9	The party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks. The rest of the film ... is dudsville.
5179	-3.35	Our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all night tequila bender    and I know this because I've seen 'jackass: the movie.'
5180	-2.2	The criticism never rises above easy, cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters...
5181	-2.2	The movie's something borrowed construction feels less the product of loving, well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan, thinly sketched story. Killing time, that's all that's going on here.
5182	-1.25	Somewhere in the middle, the film compels, as Demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems, but the field of roughage dominates.
5183	-2.05	The action clichés just pile up.
5184	-1.85	Payami tries to raise some serious issues about Iran's electoral process, but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast.
5185	-2.75	The only surprise is that heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this; I assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear.
5186	-2.85	Another useless recycling of a brutal mid '70s American sports movie.
5187	-3.2	Please, someone, stop Eric Schaeffer before he makes another film.
5188	-2.15	Most of the problems with the film don't derive from the screenplay, but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved
5189	-1.05	...if you're just in the mood for a fun    but bad    movie, you might want to catch Freaks as a matinee.
5190	-1.4	Curling may be a unique sport but Men with Brooms is distinctly ordinary.
5191	-1.19230769231	Though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors, Jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set.
5192	-1.19230769231	There's no getting around the fact that this is Revenge Of The Nerds Revisited    again.
5193	-1.96153846154	The effort is sincere and the results are honest, but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable.
5194	-1.61538461538	Analyze That regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes, with a few new swings thrown in.
5195	-2.42307692308	With flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity, Undisputed is nearly incoherent, an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it's impossible to care who wins.
5196	-3.38461538462	Stinks from start to finish, like a wet burlap sack of gloom.
5197	-2.23076923077	To the civilized mind, a movie like Ballistic: Ecks Vs. Sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement.
5198	-2.30769230769	Equlibrium could pass for a thirteen year old's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and Farenheit 451.
5199	-1.84615384615	The lack of naturalness makes everything seem self consciously poetic and forced...It's a pity that (Nelson's) achievement doesn't match his ambition.
5200	-1.23076923077	When Seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit, I wanted to stand up in the theater and shout, 'Hey, Kool Aid!'
5201	-0.769230769231	An easy watch, except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character.
5202	-0.923076923077	Imagine the CleanFlicks version of 'Love Story,' with Ali MacGraw's profanities replaced by romance novel platitudes.
5203	-1.57692307692	PC stability notwithstanding, the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat, fairy tale conclusion.
5204	-1.23076923077	Forget the misleading title, what's with the unexplained baboon cameo?
5205	-2.0	An odd, haphazard, and inconsequential romantic comedy.
5206	-1.11538461538	Though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled, others will find their humor seeking dollars best spent elsewhere.
5207	-1.03846153846	Pascale Bailly's rom com provides Amélie's Audrey Tautou with another fabuleux destin    i.e., a banal spiritual quest.
5208	-1.65384615385	A static and sugary little half hour, after school special about interfaith understanding, stretched out to 90 minutes.
5209	-0.615384615385	Watching the chemistry between Freeman and Judd, however, almost makes this movie worth seeing. Almost.
5210	-2.34615384615	... a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman.
5211	-2.0	The Country Bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers. Unfortunately, there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them, either.
5212	-2.80769230769	The cumulative effect of watching this 65 minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to Stonehenge. Before long, you're desperate for the evening to end.
5213	-1.84615384615	The characters are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach.
5214	-2.46153846154	Mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from Stock Character camp    a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self examination.
5215	-0.461538461538	Only in its final surprising shots does Rabbit Proof Fence find the authority it's looking for.
5216	-1.38461538462	Isn't as sharp as the original...Despite some visual virtues, 'Blade II' just doesn't cut it.
5217	-2.65384615385	...plays like a badly edited, 91 minute trailer (and) the director can't seem to get a coherent rhythm going. In fact, it doesn't even seem like she tried.
5218	-2.0	Maybe LeBlanc thought, ''Hey, the movie about the baseball playing monkey was worse.''
5219	-2.11538461538	What you expect is just what you get...assuming the bar of expectations hasn't been raised above sixth grade height.
5220	-1.0	Barry Sonnenfeld owes Frank the Pug big time
5221	-2.4347826087	The biggest problem with Roger Avary's uproar against the MPAA is that, even in all its director's cut glory, he's made a film that's barely shocking, barely interesting and most of all, barely anything.
5222	-2.65217391304	So riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along.
5223	-3.04347826087	I approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again, she should ask for a raise.
5224	-2.26086956522	If Sinise's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over.
5225	-2.04347826087	Too slow for a younger crowd, too shallow for an older one.
5226	-3.13043478261	There's a reason the studio didn't offer an advance screening. ''The Adventures of Pluto Nash'' is a big time stinker.
5227	-2.39130434783	A punch line without a premise, a joke built entirely from musty memories of half dimensional characters.
5228	-2.5652173913	Takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe, and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny.
5229	-1.95652173913	The things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers.
5230	-2.47826086957	Even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate, tiresome ugliness, it would be rendered tedious by Avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest.
5231	-2.65217391304	Sitting through the last reel (spoiler alert!) is significantly less charming than listening to a four year old with a taste for exaggeration recount his Halloween trip to the Haunted House.
5232	-1.95652173913	Confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please, and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses, nor their characters, deserve.
5233	-3.04347826087	Deadly dull, pointless meditation on losers in a gone to seed hotel.
5234	-2.04347826087	With this new Rollerball, sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment.
5235	-2.0	One can only assume that the jury who bestowed star Hoffman's brother Gordy with the Waldo Salt Screenwriting award at 2002's Sundance Festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off
5236	-2.08695652174	A movie more to be prescribed than recommended    as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room, complete with soothing Muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms.
5237	-0.95652173913	Sex ironically has little to do with the story, which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never, ever, leave a large dog alone with a toddler. But never mind all that; the boobs are fantasti
5238	-1.65217391304	The script covers huge, heavy topics in a bland, surfacey way that doesn't offer any insight into why, for instance, good things happen to bad people.
5239	-2.04347826087	A portrait of alienation so perfect, it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers.
5240	-1.82608695652	The code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute.
5241	-2.30434782609	Skip the film and buy the Philip Glass soundtrack CD.
5242	-2.21739130435	Feels like a cold old man going through the motions.
5243	-1.91304347826	Dignified CEO's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree. Can you bear the laughter?
5244	-2.04347826087	Dull and mechanical, kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit
5245	-2.34782608696	There's no point of view, no contemporary interpretation of Joan's prefeminist plight, so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity.
5246	-1.39130434783	Beware the quirky Brit com. They can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental.
5247	0.130434782609	Has its moments    and almost as many subplots.
5248	-0.173913043478	The gags, and the script, are a mixed bag.
5249	-3.13043478261	Completely awful Iranian drama...as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque.
5250	-2.78260869565	Narratively, Trouble Every Day is a plodding mess.
5251	-1.31578947368	There's no point in extracting the bare bones of Byatt's plot for purposes of bland Hollywood romance.
5252	-0.947368421053	Directors John Musker and Ron Clements, the team behind The Little Mermaid, have produced sparkling retina candy, but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space.
5253	-1.94736842105	Adam Sandler's heart may be in the right place, but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
5254	-1.42105263158	There's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for Egoyan, but it's also one that, next to his best work, feels clumsy and convoluted.
5255	-1.21052631579	Despite engaging offbeat touches, Knockaround Guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that's as fresh faced as its young guns cast.
5256	-2.10526315789	It's all pretty tame. The most offensive thing about the movie is that Hollywood expects people to pay to see it.
5257	-3.15789473684	The movie is a mess from start to finish.
5258	-1.84210526316	The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than, as was more likely, a victim of mental illness.
5259	-1.26315789474	I'm not saying that Ice Age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures, but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life.
5260	-1.05263157895	In the telling of a story largely untold, Bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar.
5261	-2.78947368421	The plot is nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish, and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience, but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
5262	-3.63157894737	Terminally brain dead production.
5263	-0.789473684211	Some episodes work, some don't.
5264	0.0526315789474	Beautifully filmed and well acted... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics.
5265	-1.05263157895	J. Lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie, although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear: She's a pretty woman, but she's no working girl.
5266	-1.73684210526	Rymer doesn't trust laughs    and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead undead genre, who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects.
5267	-2.57894736842	Not only are the film's Sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny, they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're  doing it for  the cash' sequel were.
5268	-3.26315789474	Wow. I have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time.
5269	-2.21052631579	Off the Hook is overlong and not well acted, but credit writer producer director Adam Watstein with finishing it at all.
5270	-1.68421052632	It's a drag how Nettelbeck sees working women    or at least this working woman    for whom she shows little understanding.
5271	-1.0	Watching Harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death, but Boyd's film offers little else of consequence.
5272	-2.26315789474	It's also curious to note that this film, like the similarly ill timed Antitrust, is easily as bad at a fraction the budget.
5273	-2.10526315789	Will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002.
5274	-1.89473684211	The problem is not that it's all derivative, because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes. The problem is that Van Wilder does little that is actually funny with the material.
5275	-2.63157894737	There's nothing interesting in Unfaithful whatsoever.
5276	-1.89473684211	None of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think.
5277	-1.89473684211	A processed comedy chop suey.
5278	-1.89473684211	As spent screen series go, Star Trek: Nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up    and there's nothing to drink.
5279	-2.63157894737	Fails as a dystopian movie, as a retooling of Fahrenheit 451, and even as a rip off of The Matrix.
5280	-2.78947368421	Full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self aware neurotics engage in.
5281	-1.78260869565	An erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling, either.
5282	-2.13043478261	The movie, like Bartleby, is something of a stiff    an extra dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes.
5283	-1.91304347826	With its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters ... Margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake.
5284	-3.04347826087	If you value your time and money, find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite, predictable rehash.
5285	-1.73913043478	The director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of New Age inspired good intentions, but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing.
5286	-1.08695652174	Everything is pegged into the groove of a New York dating comedy with 'issues' to simplify.
5287	-1.21739130435	A dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any Hollywood fluff.
5288	-1.78260869565	The cameo packed, M:I 2 spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise...Then Mike Myers shows up and ruins everything.
5289	-1.4347826087	It comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if BA, Murdock and rest of the A Team were seen giving chase in a black and red van.
5290	-2.13043478261	The 50 something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about.
5291	-1.04347826087	So genial is the conceit, this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout, dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen. It never is, not fully.
5292	-1.39130434783	Even in the summertime, the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities.
5293	-1.39130434783	What with all the blanket statements and dime store ruminations on vanity, the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom, the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time.
5294	-1.60869565217	As gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character, there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy, clean cut Dahmer (Jeremy Renner) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge.
5295	-2.34782608696	Plodding, peevish and gimmicky.
5296	-0.347826086957	The Four Feathers is definitely horse feathers, but if you go in knowing that, you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox.
5297	-2.13043478261	Oozes condescension from every pore.
5298	-2.4347826087	''Solaris'' is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work.
5299	-1.78260869565	The direction, by George Hickenlooper, has no snap to it, no wiseacre crackle or hard bitten cynicism.
5300	-1.34782608696	Though this saga would be terrific to read about, it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch.
5301	-0.869565217391	It has plenty of laughs. It just doesn't have much else... especially in a moral sense.
5302	-2.52173913043	An awful lot like one of (Spears') music videos in content    except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and, worse, that you have to pay if you want to see it.
5303	-2.52173913043	Confusion is one of my least favourite emotions, especially when I have to put up with 146 minutes of it.
5304	-2.13043478261	(H)ad I suffered and bled on the hard ground of Ia Drang, I'd want something a bit more complex than We Were Soldiers to be remembered by.
5305	-2.0	Occasionally loud and offensive, but more often, it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma.
5306	-1.08695652174	it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like My Big Fat Greek Wedding
5307	-2.08695652174	By the time you reach the finale, you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing.
5308	-2.69565217391	Journalistically dubious, inept and often lethally dull.
5309	-2.13043478261	Putting the primitive murderer inside a high tech space station unleashes a Pandora's Box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest.
5310	-0.869565217391	At its best, it's Black Hawk Down with more heart. At its worst, it's Rambo  meets John Ford.
5311	-0.714285714286	Exactly what you'd expect from a guy named Kaos.
5312	-3.19047619048	This movie ... doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is.
5313	-2.61904761905	With or without ballast tanks, K 19 sinks to a Harrison Ford low.
5314	-1.66666666667	Director Oliver Parker labors so hard to whip life into The Importance of Being Earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two.
5315	-1.14285714286	You might be shocked to discover that Seinfeld's real life is boring.
5316	0.047619047619	It's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor, but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time.
5317	-1.28571428571	Walsh can't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in Janice's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm.
5318	-1.85714285714	This 10th film in the series looks and feels tired.
5319	-1.57142857143	It leers, offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject.
5320	-2.09523809524	I found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as Vincent became more and more abhorrent.
5321	-1.71428571429	One of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history.
5322	-2.90476190476	There's nothing to gain from watching They. It isn't scary. It hates its characters. It finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers.
5323	-1.04761904762	Fear permeates the whole of Stortelling, Todd Solondz' oftentimes funny, yet ultimately cowardly autocritique.
5324	-1.04761904762	The skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense.
5325	-0.571428571429	... Ice Age treads predictably along familiar territory, making it a passable family film that won't win many fans over the age of 12.
5326	-0.761904761905	Though the film is well intentioned, one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable.
5327	-1.61904761905	Just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience.
5328	-2.33333333333	The video work is so grainy and rough, so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up, that it's exhausting to watch.
5329	-1.28571428571	A cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary.
5330	-0.666666666667	It gets bogged down by hit and miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff.
5331	-1.14285714286	An achingly enthralling premise, the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses.
5332	-2.09523809524	It's Tommy's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her, and after viewing this one, you'll feel like mopping up, too.
5333	-2.71428571429	Rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a Hubert Selby Jr., but there isn't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script; it's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative.
5334	-3.52380952381	Such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show.
5335	-2.85714285714	If you go into the theater expecting a scary, action packed chiller, you might soon be looking for a sign. An EXIT sign, that is.
5336	-1.42857142857	Holds limited appeal to those who like explosions, sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp.
5337	-1.7619047619	The dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed.
5338	-0.857142857143	A feature length, R rated, road trip version of Mama's Family.
5339	-0.857142857143	What you end up getting is the Vertical Limit of surfing movies   memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between.
5340	-2.2380952381	Stealing Harvard doesn't care about cleverness, wit or any other kind of intelligent humor.
5341	-1.10526315789	Bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense, and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly.
5342	-0.947368421053	There's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references, but the fun wears thin    then out    when there's nothing else happening.
5343	-2.10526315789	Imagine Kevin Smith, the blasphemous bad boy of suburban Jersey, if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor. The result might look like Vulgar.
5344	-2.15789473684	Suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as Dahmer demands.
5345	-1.94736842105	What soured me on The Santa Clause 2 was that Santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard, it's icky.
5346	-2.84210526316	It's an 88 minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long.
5347	-0.578947368421	The film favors the scientific over the spectacular (visually speaking).
5348	-3.26315789474	Such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema.
5349	-2.31578947368	With the exception of McCoist, the players don't have a clue on the park. The acting isn't much better.
5350	-1.57894736842	The whole affair is as predictable as can be.
5351	-1.36842105263	A not so Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood with a hefty helping of Re Fried Green Tomatoes.
5352	-2.78947368421	This cloying, voices from the other side story is hell.
5353	-2.42105263158	A suffocating rape payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre's most enabling victim ... and an ebullient affection for industrial model meat freezers.
5354	-2.10526315789	Star Trek was kind of terrific once, but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy.
5355	-1.73684210526	(N)o matter how much good will the actors generate, Showtime eventually folds under its own thinness.
5356	-2.47368421053	Every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance, every performance respectably muted; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of Rohypnol.
5357	-1.52631578947	Puts on airs of a Hal Hartley wannabe film    without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer director himself.
5358	-2.10526315789	Ver Wiel's desperate attempt at wit is lost, leaving the character of Critical Jim two dimensional and pointless.
5359	-1.31578947368	Despite a performance of sustained intelligence from Stanford and another of subtle humour from Bebe Neuwirth, as an older woman who seduces Oscar, the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu   rich New York intelligentsia   and its off
5360	-1.26315789474	Although Disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure, it feels more forced than usual.
5361	-2.15789473684	Gaghan ... has thrown every suspenseful cliché in the book at this nonsensical story.
5362	-2.63157894737	A sham construct based on theory, sleight of hand, and ill wrought hypothesis.
5363	-1.42105263158	(P)artnering Murphy with Robert De Niro for the TV cops comedy Showtime would seem to be surefire casting. The catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders.
5364	-0.894736842105	'You'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half, but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied. You'll feel like you ate a Reeses without the peanut butter...'
5365	-1.57894736842	Gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance.
5366	-1.21052631579	Parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material, but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone ... that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core.
5367	-1.78947368421	The director has injected self consciousness into the proceedings at every turn. The results are far more alienating than involving.
5368	-1.63157894737	Bogdanich is unashamedly pro Serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side.
5369	-2.05263157895	A lack of thesis makes Maryam, in the end, play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after school special.
5370	-2.15789473684	Without Shakespeare's eloquent language, the update is dreary and sluggish.
5371	-0.933333333333	If H.G. Wells had a time machine and could take a look at his kin's reworked version, what would he say? 'It looks good, Sonny, but you missed the point.'
5372	-1.86666666667	During The Tuxedo's 90 minutes of screen time, there isn't one true 'Chan moment'.
5373	-1.33333333333	Bisset delivers a game performance, but she is unable to save the movie.
5374	-1.26666666667	Watching Austin Powers in Goldmember is like binging on cotton candy. It's sweet and fluffy at the time, but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied.
5375	-2.13333333333	The most anti human big studio picture since 3000 Miles to Graceland.
5376	-2.6	The film can depress you about life itself.
5377	-1.6	I'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept, but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap cliché.
5378	-1.53333333333	The acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the Wal Mart checkout line.
5379	-1.33333333333	Its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters, but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers.
5380	-1.66666666667	The plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before Janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel.
5381	-2.6	Sometimes there are very, very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely.
5382	-1.46666666667	At 90 minutes this movie is short, but it feels much longer.
5383	-1.93333333333	Here's my advice, Kev. Start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line.
5384	-2.0	An alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom...you'd be wise to send your regrets.
5385	-2.8	An ugly duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental.
5386	-2.0	Unfortunately, it's also not very good. Especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie.
5387	-0.866666666667	It wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new, at least it looks pretty.
5388	-2.26666666667	Glazed with a tawdry B movie scum.
5389	-2.86666666667	This is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you, at its cluelessness, at its idiocy, at its utterly misplaced earnestness.
5390	-1.2	It winds up moving in many directions as it searches (vainly, I think) for something fresh to say.
5391	-1.13333333333	All in all, Road to Perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence.
5392	-2.86666666667	A big fat pain.
5393	-1.66666666667	A mimetic approximation of better films like Contempt and 8 1/2.
5394	-2.4	Unintelligible, poorly acted, brain slappingly bad, Harvard Man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic.
5395	-2.26666666667	Watching The Powerpuff Girls Movie, my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison: the cartoon in Japan that gave people seizures.
5396	-2.0	An inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength.
5397	-1.73333333333	To build a feel good fantasy around a vain dictator madman is off putting, to say the least, not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved.
5398	-2.06666666667	With the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof, which They isn't, it is more likely to induce sleep than fright.
5399	-1.26666666667	Mild, meandering teen flick.
5400	-0.866666666667	Though its atmosphere is intriguing ... the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression.
5401	-1.05882352941	Though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut busting laughs, its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before.
5402	-0.764705882353	Although it tries to be much more, it's really just another Major League.
5403	-3.11764705882	Astonishing isn't the word    neither is incompetent, incoherent or just plain crap. Indeed, none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is Deuces Wild.
5404	-0.823529411765	One thing is for sure: This movie does not tell you a whole lot about Lily Chou Chou.
5405	-0.823529411765	With a tone as variable as the cinematography, Schaeffer's film never settles into the light footed enchantment the material needs, and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm.
5406	-1.58823529412	To better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing, and I won't be sitting through this one again...that in itself is commentary enough.
5407	-1.29411764706	Cuba Gooding Jr. valiantly mugs his way through Snow Dogs, but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy.
5408	-1.35294117647	Diane Lane's sophisticated performance can't rescue Adrian Lyne's Unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing.
5409	-1.76470588235	Not at all clear what it's trying to say and even if it were – I doubt it would be all that interesting.
5410	-2.11764705882	(Swimfan) falls victim to sloppy plotting, an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting.
5411	-2.76470588235	This remake of Lina Wertmuller's 1975 eroti comedy might just be the biggest husband and wife disaster since John and Bo Derek made the ridiculous Bolero.
5412	-0.588235294118	Silly, loud and goofy.
5413	-1.88235294118	Why spend $9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby?
5414	-2.82352941176	The French director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused, excruciatingly tedious cinema that, half an hour in, starts making water torture seem appealing.
5415	-2.05882352941	The basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy.
5416	-2.17647058824	The Pool drowned me in boredom.
5417	-1.35294117647	It's like an all star salute to Disney's cheesy commercialism.
5418	-2.64705882353	It's hard to imagine any recent film, independent or otherwise, that makes as much of a mess as this one.
5419	-1.0	Some of the computer animation is handsome, and various amusing sidekicks add much needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale, but overall the film never rises above mediocrity.
5420	-1.17647058824	There's an excellent 90 minute film here; unfortunately, it runs for 170.
5421	-1.76470588235	As saccharine movies go, this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses.
5422	0.294117647059	Die Another Day is only intermittently entertaining but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms, or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with.
5423	-0.823529411765	As is often the case with ambitious, eager first time filmmakers, Mr. Murray, a prolific director of music videos, stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold.
5424	-1.29411764706	The mystery of Enigma is how a rich historical subject, combined with so much first rate talent ... could have yielded such a flat, plodding picture.
5425	-1.41176470588	It throws quirky characters, odd situations, and off kilter dialogue at us, all as if to say, ''Look at this! This is an interesting movie!'' But the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging.
5426	-1.58823529412	The inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid.
5427	-2.05882352941	It's not only dull because we've seen (Eddie) Murphy do the genial rogue shtick to death, but because the plot is equally hackneyed.
5428	-1.11764705882	Avary's film never quite emerges from the shadow of Ellis' book.
5429	-2.17647058824	A poorly scripted, preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent, believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda.
5430	-1.17647058824	While it is interesting to witness the conflict from the Palestinian side, Longley's film lacks balance ... and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context.
5431	-1.18181818182	Woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director, but how long will filmmakers copy the ''Saving Private Ryan'' battle scenes before realizing Steven Spielberg got it right the first time?
5432	-1.40909090909	It's sincere to a fault, but, unfortunately, not very compelling or much fun.
5433	-1.45454545455	... Jones, despite a definitely distinctive screen presence, just isn't able to muster for a movie that, its title notwithstanding, should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead's specific gifts.
5434	-1.27272727273	This follow up seems so similar to the 1953 Disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric Peter.
5435	-1.5	Why, you may ask, why should you buy the movie milk when the TV cow is free? There's no good answer to that one.
5436	-2.40909090909	This slow moving Swedish film offers not even a hint of joy, preferring to focus on the humiliation of Martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party.
5437	-2.63636363636	A muddled limp biscuit of a movie, a vampire soap opera that doesn't make much sense even on its own terms.
5438	-2.95454545455	There's the plot, and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream.
5439	-2.40909090909	This is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action.
5440	-2.40909090909	This is amusing for about three minutes.
5441	-2.77272727273	Klein, charming in comedies like American Pie and dead on in Election, delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed.
5442	-2.59090909091	It's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from ''promising'' to ''interesting'' to ''familiar'' before landing squarely on ''stupid''.
5443	-3.45454545455	This is the sort of low grade dreck that usually goes straight to video   with a lousy script, inept direction, pathetic acting, poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography, complete with visible boom mikes.
5444	-1.77272727273	The direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence, but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why.
5445	-2.18181818182	There are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending.
5446	-1.0	It won't harm anyone, but neither can I think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it. After all, it'll probably be in video stores by Christmas, and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies.
5447	-1.86363636364	Looks more like a travel agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent community guiding lights.
5448	-1.95454545455	Given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece, the picture begins to resemble the shapeless, grasping actors' workshop that it is.
5449	-1.40909090909	They kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who haven't read the book.
5450	-1.81818181818	Just because A Walk to Remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts doesn't mean it's good enough for our girls.
5451	-1.68181818182	(Carvey's) characters are both overplayed and exaggerated, but then again, subtlety has never been his trademark.
5452	-1.40909090909	It's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar American style of justice that plays out here, but it's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through.
5453	-2.31818181818	This dreadfully earnest inversion of the Concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug eyed mugging and gay niche condescension.
5454	-1.59090909091	Brown's saga, like many before his, makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie.
5455	-1.36363636364	The boys' sparring, like the succession of blows dumped on Guei, wears down the story's more cerebral, and likable, plot elements.
5456	-1.36363636364	The script by Vincent R. Nebrida ... tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot.
5457	-1.59090909091	The story is so light and sugary that were it a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon, extra heavy duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away.
5458	-1.77272727273	Oedekerk mugs mercilessly, and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between.
5459	-1.36363636364	Since Dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer, it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche.
5460	-1.95454545455	Only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate.
5461	0.1875	Cold and scattered, Minority Report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals. That's not vintage Spielberg and that, finally, is minimally satisfying.
5462	-3.125	Every now and again, a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be. Frank McKlusky C.I. is that movie!
5463	-1.4375	It's not difficult to spot the culprit early on in this predictable thriller.
5464	-2.0625	...a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers.
5465	-1.5	The trappings of I Spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun.
5466	-1.0	What starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film.
5467	-1.1875	In the wake of Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down and We Were Soldiers, you are likely to be as heartily sick of mayhem as Cage's war weary marine.
5468	-3.0	It is messy, uncouth, incomprehensible, vicious and absurd.
5469	-1.375	Really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length.
5470	-2.3125	Hampered    no, paralyzed    by a self indulgent script ... that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire.
5471	-2.6875	Cheap, vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail's pace.
5472	-1.9375	And if you appreciate the one sided theme to Lawrence's over indulgent tirade, then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self glorified Martin Lawrence lovefest. If you are willing to do this, then you so crazy!
5473	-2.0	Directed without the expected flair or imagination by Hong Kong master John Woo, Windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two hour and fifteen minute length.
5474	0.8125	It's a very tasteful rock and roll movie. You could put it on a coffee table anywhere.
5475	-1.0	The movie is loaded with good intentions, but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all too familiar dramatic arc of the Holocaust escape story, Minac drains his movie of all individuality.
5476	-2.375	An infuriating film. Just when you think you are making sense of it, something happens that tells you there is no sense.
5477	-2.125	The entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory.
5478	-1.0625	The setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas, which never reach satisfying conclusions.
5479	-2.25	As an entertainment destination for the general public, Kung Pow sets a new benchmark for lameness.
5480	-1.6875	This misty eyed Southern nostalgia piece, in treading the line between sappy and sanguine, winds up mired in tear drenched quicksand.
5481	-2.5	As pure over the top trash, any John Waters movie has it beat by a country mile.
5482	-1.5	Wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art house crowd, but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time.
5483	-1.875	Bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable. But for the most part, The Weight of Water comes off as a two way time switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness.
5484	-1.9375	This film biggest problem? No laughs.
5485	-1.3125	Less than compelling documentary of a Yiddish theater clan.
5486	-1.3125	That the Chuck Norris ''grenade gag'' occurs about 7 times during Windtalkers is a good indication of how serious minded the film is.
5487	-1.8125	Viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for Holm's performance, the film would be a total washout.
5488	-0.375	It's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date, but when it comes out on video, it's well worth a rental.
5489	-3.0	I can't begin to tell you how tedious, how resolutely unamusing, how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is, and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents...
5490	0.8125	Everybody loves a David and Goliath story, and this one is told almost entirely from David's point of view.
5491	-1.06666666667	Throw Smoochy from the train!
5492	-1.73333333333	Eventually, they will have a showdown, but, by then, your senses are as mushy as peas and you don't care who fires the winning shot.
5493	-1.26666666667	Irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free.
5494	-1.26666666667	A light, engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation.
5495	-0.933333333333	Cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle.
5496	-1.53333333333	To paraphrase a line from another Dickens' novel, Nicholas Nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato.
5497	-0.8	The actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly, but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types.
5498	-1.6	The result, however well intentioned, is ironically just the sort of disposable, kitchen sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's Hollywood.
5499	-3.4	An extremely unpleasant film.
5500	-0.333333333333	A movie just for Friday fans, critics be damned. If you already like this sort of thing, this is that sort of thing all over again.
5501	0.133333333333	A sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming of age tale.
5502	-1.33333333333	Wait for it to hit cable.
5503	-1.4	Ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies.
5504	-2.13333333333	Nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time, something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives.
5505	-2.6	77 minutes of Pokemon may not last 4ever, it just seems like it does. My only wish is that Celebi could take me back to a time before I saw this movie and I could just skip it.
5506	-1.93333333333	The one not so small problem with Expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point.
5507	-1.13333333333	A movie you observe, rather than one you enter into.
5508	0.666666666667	(At least) Moore is a real charmer.
5509	-1.8	John Carlen's script is full of unhappy, two dimensional characters who are anything but compelling.
5510	-1.8	LaBute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era: He's changed the male academic from a lower class Brit to an American, a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film.
5511	-2.13333333333	The notion of deleting emotion from people, even in an advanced Prozac Nation, is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed Equilibrium becomes a concept doofus.
5512	-0.866666666667	Stale first act, Scrooge story, blatant product placement, some very good comedic songs, strong finish, dumb fart jokes.
5513	-1.53333333333	Unsurprisingly, the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers, instead of serious athletes.
5514	-1.8	A film that loses sight of its own story.
5515	-1.53333333333	Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights grows on you    like a rash.
5516	-2.06666666667	The big screen Scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well crafted in comparison.
5517	-1.13333333333	Few of the increasingly far fetched events that first time writer director Neil Burger follows up with are terribly convincing, which is a pity, considering Barry's terrific performance.
5518	0.466666666667	Gets better after Foster leaves that little room.
5519	-1.33333333333	The movie is as padded as Allen's jelly belly.
5520	-1.53333333333	Resident Evil isn't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an MTV, sugar hysteria, and PlayStation cocktail.
5521	0.7	A rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by Epps.
5522	-2.85	...unspeakably, unbearably dull, featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim witted.
5523	-1.3	Resembles a soft porn Brian De Palma pastiche.
5524	-0.7	Bluto Blutarsky, we miss you.
5525	-0.3	Innocuous enough to make even Jean Claude Van Damme look good.
5526	-2.15	It's a glorified sitcom, and a long, unfunny one at that.
5527	-1.6	Woody Allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody. But I had a lot of problems with this movie.
5528	-2.35	Devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special.
5529	-1.6	All movie long, City by the Sea swings from one approach to the other, but in the end, it stays in formula    which is a waste of De Niro, McDormand and the other good actors in the cast.
5530	-3.65	Plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year.
5531	-1.5	However sincere it may be, The Rising Place never quite justifies its own existence.
5532	-1.25	Parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today, without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place.
5533	-1.8	It's sort of a 21st century morality play with a Latino hip hop beat. But the second half of the movie really goes downhill.
5534	-1.15	Paxton's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre.
5535	-2.65	The script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair.
5536	-1.9	The script falls back on too many tried and true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy.
5537	-1.55	The film starts promisingly, but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work.
5538	-2.0	Let's issue a moratorium, effective immediately, on treacly films about inspirational prep school professors and the children they so heartwarmingly motivate.
5539	-2.55	It's the element of condescension, as the filmmakers look down on their working class subjects from their lofty perch, that finally makes Sex With Strangers, which opens today in the New York metropolitan area, so distasteful.
5540	-0.1	Alternately frustrating and rewarding.
5541	-1.45	It's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure.
5542	-1.85	Despite suffering a sense of humour failure, The Man Who Wrote Rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this.
5543	-1.85	Swinging, the film makes it seem, is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit. Or intelligent.
5544	-2.65	The most memorable moment was when Green threw medical equipment at a window; not because it was particularly funny, but because I had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration.
5545	-3.0	See Clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes. But be warned, you too may feel time has decided to stand still. Or that the battery on your watch has died.
5546	-1.75	Suffers from over familiarity since hit hungry British filmmakers have strip mined the Monty formula mercilessly since 1997.
5547	-0.1	There are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile button faces on that segment of the populace that made A Walk to Remember a niche hit.
5548	-1.85	Yes, I have given this movie a rating of zero. But fans of the show should not consider this a diss. Consider it 'perfection.'
5549	-3.05	The cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing.
5550	1.3	Children and adults enamored of all things Pokemon won't be disappointed.
5551	-2.73333333333	I don't even care that there's no plot in this Antonio Banderas Lucy Liu faceoff. It's still terrible!
5552	-0.666666666667	Children of the Century, though well dressed and well made, ultimately falls prey to the contradiction that afflicts so many movies about writers.
5553	-1.6	It's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the National Basketball Association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster boy Lil' Bow Wow.
5554	-1.33333333333	Peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed, adult hindsight.
5555	-0.8	A close to solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late.
5556	-1.46666666667	Cloaks a familiar anti feminist equation (career   kids = misery) in tiresome romantic comedy duds.
5557	-1.06666666667	The Good Girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming.
5558	-1.86666666667	Just a collection of this and that    whatever fills time    with no unified whole.
5559	-2.46666666667	The animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death, if the poor quality of Pokemon 4 Ever is any indication.
5560	-2.13333333333	Only about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that reminds at every turn of Elizabeth Berkley's flopping dolphin gasm.
5561	-1.6	Kids who are into this Thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven. Anyone else who may, for whatever reason, be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning.
5562	-2.0	Mr. Soderbergh's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious.
5563	-0.0666666666667	Do you say ''hi'' to your lover when you wake up in the morning?
5564	-2.4	It makes me feel weird / Thinking about all the bad things in the world / Like puppies with broken legs / And butterflies that die / And movies starring pop queens
5565	-1.73333333333	Director Tom Dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut Shanghai Noon, but Showtime's uninspired send up of TV cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks.
5566	-1.4	'Yes, that's right: it's Forrest Gump, Angel Of Death.'
5567	-0.733333333333	A wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others, thanks to the actors, that are quite touching.
5568	-1.93333333333	While easier to sit through than most of Jaglom's self conscious and gratingly irritating films, it's still tainted by cliches, painful improbability and murky points.
5569	-3.0	About as enjoyable, I would imagine, as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces...positively dreadful.
5570	-1.26666666667	A generic international version of a typical American horror film.
5571	-1.06666666667	... while certainly clever in spots, this too long, spoofy update of Shakespeare's Macbeth doesn't sustain a high enough level of invention.
5572	-1.93333333333	Lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap, graceless, hackneyed sci fi serials of the '30s and '40s.
5573	-1.33333333333	There's a lot of good material here, but there's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it.
5574	-2.46666666667	Absurdities and clichés accumulate like lint in a fat man's navel.
5575	-0.733333333333	If you think it's a riot to see Rob Schneider in a young woman's clothes, then you'll enjoy The Hot Chick.
5576	-2.4	The sheer dumbness of the plot (other than its one good idea) and the movie's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down.
5577	-0.8	Strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild.
5578	-1.73333333333	The next big thing's not so big (and not so hot) directorial debut.
5579	-1.66666666667	Yet another iteration of what's become one of the movies' creepiest conventions, in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble, teach and ultimately redeem their mentally ''superior'' friends, family...
5580	-1.8	Bond inspired? Certainly. Likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise? Let's hope not.
5581	-2.46666666667	This flat run at a hip hop Tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of Pootie Tang in between its punchlines.
5582	-1.26666666667	Davis has energy, but she doesn't bother to make her heroine's book sound convincing, the gender war ideas original, or the comic scenes fly.
5583	-1.26666666667	Surprisingly, considering that Baird is a former film editor, the movie is rather choppy.
5584	-2.13333333333	None of this is very original, and it isn't particularly funny.
5585	-2.4	...a bland murder on campus yawner.
5586	-1.8	A humorless journey into a philosophical void.
5587	-2.73333333333	These two are generating about as much chemistry as an Iraqi factory poised to receive a UN inspector.
5588	-2.2	Just as the lousy Tarantino imitations have subsided, here comes the first lousy Guy Ritchie imitation.
5589	-1.13333333333	A passable romantic comedy, in need of another couple of passes through the word processor.
5590	-1.8	The movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre    the gangster/crime comedy    that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago, and its cutesy reliance on movie specific cliches isn't exactly endearing.
5591	-1.53333333333	shows Holmes has the screen presence to become a major league leading lady, (but) the movie itself is an underachiever, a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives.
5592	-1.73333333333	Ultimately ... the movie is too heady for children, and too preachy for adults.
5593	-1.0	It's just a little too self satisfied.
5594	-0.933333333333	Clever but not especially compelling.
5595	-1.93333333333	McKay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages, apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service.
5596	-1.13333333333	A piece of mildly entertaining, inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever growing category: unembarrassing but unmemorable.
5597	-1.66666666667	LaBute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public.
5598	-2.46666666667	The movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne.
5599	-2.06666666667	The problem with ANTWONE FISHER is that it has a screenplay written by Antwone Fisher based on the book by Antwone Fisher.
5600	-1.0	Alarms for Duvall's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks.
5601	-1.86666666667	What little grace (Rifkin's) tale of precarious skid row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics.
5602	-2.06666666667	Tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of Animal House but instead comes closer to the failure of the third Revenge of the Nerds sequel.
5603	-1.8	Unfortunately, Kapur modernizes A.E.W. Mason's story to suit the sensibilities of a young American, a decision that plucks ''The Four Feathers'' bare.
5604	-2.53333333333	...what a banal bore the preachy Circuit turns out to be
5605	-1.66666666667	Falsehoods pile up, undermining the movie's reality and stifling its creator's comic voice.
5606	-1.2	A mechanical action comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic Jackie Chan to even younger audiences.
5607	-2.8	One of the most incoherent features in recent memory.
5608	-2.6	Low rent from frame one.
5609	-1.8	Eight Legged Freaks? No big hairy deal.
5610	-2.2	The issues are presented in such a lousy way, complete with some of the year's (unintentionally) funniest moments, that it's impossible to care.
5611	-1.90909090909	Laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany.
5612	-1.22727272727	The respective charms of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant have worn threadbare.
5613	-3.13636363636	'This movie sucks.'
5614	-1.86363636364	None of this so called satire has any sting to it, as if Woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally, to some extent, warmed up to him.
5615	0.0	A few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed, but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater.
5616	-1.63636363636	Bad in such a bizarre way that it's almost worth seeing, if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste.
5617	-1.59090909091	There's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie.
5618	-0.363636363636	Hugh Grant's act is so consuming that sometimes it's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are.
5619	-1.86363636364	Although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original, the first film's lovely flakiness is gone, replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks.
5620	-3.0	I've had more interesting    and, dare I say, thematically complex    bowel movements than this long on the shelf, point and shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama.
5621	-0.818181818182	What we get ... is Caddyshack crossed with the Loyal Order of Raccoons.
5622	-2.27272727273	The jokes are flat, and the action looks fake.
5623	-1.63636363636	When a movie asks you to feel sorry for Mick Jagger's sex life, it already has one strike against it.
5624	-1.72727272727	There are now two signs that M. Night Shyamalan's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema: Unbreakable and Signs.
5625	-2.0	...hokey art house pretension.
5626	-2.5	... a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off.
5627	-1.72727272727	Gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it's not clear whether we're supposed to shriek or laugh.
5628	-2.86363636364	Plodding, poorly written, murky and weakly acted, the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo.
5629	-2.86363636364	This is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions    a lunar mission with no signs of life.
5630	-1.86363636364	A baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside Danish cows falls flat, and if you're going to alter the Bard's ending, you'd better have a good alternative.
5631	-1.5	Soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted, earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable.
5632	-2.09090909091	The only thing that distinguishes a Randall Wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a Randall Wallace film.
5633	-2.0	Silly stuff, all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who can't quite distinguish one sci fi work from another.
5634	-1.31818181818	There is so much plodding sensitivity.
5635	-1.13636363636	The town has kind of an authentic feel, but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial.
5636	-1.45454545455	...too sappy for its own good.
5637	-1.27272727273	Circuit queens won't learn a thing, they'll be too busy cursing the film's strategically placed white sheets.
5638	-1.72727272727	As an actress, Madonna is one helluva singer. As the Mediterranean sparkles, 'Swept Away' sinks.
5639	-2.59090909091	Every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid, so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy. Half Past Dead is just such an achievement.
5640	-1.31818181818	Expanded to 65 minutes for theatrical release, it still feels somewhat unfinished.
5641	-1.5	It all looks and plays like a $40 million version of a game you're more likely to enjoy on a computer.
5642	-0.625	(Javier Bardem is) one of the few reasons to watch the film, which director Gerardo Vera has drenched in swoony music and fever pitched melodrama.
5643	-1.75	Feels shrill, simple and soapy.
5644	-1.25	Adults, other than the parents...will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild.
5645	-2.1875	Brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors ... by shoving them into every clichéd white trash situation imaginable.
5646	-1.5625	In the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick, The Emperor's Club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach.
5647	-2.125	No amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie's lack of ideas.
5648	-2.5625	A direct to void release, heading nowhere.
5649	-1.8125	Typical animé, with cheapo animation (like Saturday morning TV in the '60s), a complex sword and sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and Japanese names.
5650	-2.4375	Below is well below expectations.
5651	-1.9375	At no point during K 19:The Widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that, though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty, courage and dedication to a common goal, never seems to leave the lot.
5652	-1.25	...standard guns versus martial arts cliche with little new added.
5653	-2.0625	Empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film. It doesn't work as either.
5654	-2.4375	Given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it, the project should have been made for the tube.
5655	-0.5625	Possession is in the end an honorable, interesting failure. It falls far short of poetry, but it's not bad prose.
5656	-0.875	Jonathan Parker's Bartleby should have been the be all end all of the modern office anomie films.
5657	-1.8125	There may have been a good film in ''Trouble Every Day,'' but it is not what is on the screen.
5658	-1.875	Unfortunately, Carvey's rubber face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with Harris Goldberg.
5659	-2.0	Viewed as a comedy, a romance, a fairy tale, or a drama, there's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture.
5660	-1.1875	There's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity, given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments, clothes and parties.
5661	-2.375	The Master of Disguise is funny  not ''ha ha'' funny, ''dead circus performer'' funny. And for all the wrong reasons besides.
5662	-2.625	A zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects, hoary dialogue, fluxing accents, and    worst of all    silly looking Morlocks.
5663	-3.375	A 75 minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless, witless, and devoid of anything resembling humor.
5664	-2.375	You leave feeling like you've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing.
5665	-3.125	The waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity, incoherence and sub sophomoric sexual banter.
5666	-2.25	With McConaughey in an entirely irony free zone and Bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids, there's not enough intelligence, wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd.
5667	-0.5625	It's the type of stunt the Academy loves: a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film.
5668	-1.875	In theory, a middle aged romance pairing Clayburgh and Tambor sounds promising, but in practice it's something else altogether    clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life.
5669	-3.0625	So mind numbingly awful that you hope Britney won't do it one more time, as far as movies are concerned.
5670	-1.5	The images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos, particularly where Whitaker's misfit artist is concerned.
5671	-1.63157894737	If Welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two, he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way.
5672	-3.68421052632	Sets animation back 30 years, musicals back 40 years and Judaism back at least 50.
5673	-1.63157894737	Weirdly, Broomfield has compelling new material but he doesn't unveil it until the end, after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car.
5674	-1.05263157895	Might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper.
5675	0.684210526316	eventually arrives at its heart, as simple self reflection meditation.
5676	0.473684210526	A showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor Michel Serrault, the film is less successful on other levels.
5677	-1.68421052632	Boy oh boy, it's a howler.
5678	-1.68421052632	A few pieces of the film buzz and whir; very little of it actually clicks. The thing just never gets off the ground.
5679	-1.84210526316	...contains very few laughs and even less surprises.
5680	-2.26315789474	The actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face.
5681	-1.26315789474	Most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots. The movie isn't horrible, but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave.
5682	-0.105263157895	However stale the material, Lawrence's delivery remains perfect; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn out, pandering palaver is actually funny.
5683	-2.0	There's nothing remotely topical or sexy here.
5684	-2.94736842105	The Tuxedo wasn't just bad; it was, as my friend David Cross would call it, 'Hungry Man portions of bad'.
5685	-2.47368421053	Blue Crush is so prolonged and boring it isn't even close to being the barn burningly bad movie it promised it would be.
5686	-1.84210526316	The sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give Blade fans another look at Wesley Snipes' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys    at once.
5687	-1.52631578947	While Van Wilder may not be the worst National Lampoon film, it's far from being this generation's Animal House.
5688	-2.42105263158	So devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it cannot even be dubbed hedonistic.
5689	-3.47368421053	Reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish.
5690	-1.94736842105	An exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter.
5691	-1.89473684211	Woody Allen has really found his groove these days. The problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another.
5692	-1.52631578947	The bland outweighs the nifty, and Cletis Tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is.
5693	-2.10526315789	It's such a mechanical endeavor (that) it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it.
5694	1.84210526316	The art direction is often exquisite, and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design, leaving one to hope that the eventual DVD release will offer subtitles and the original Italian language soundtrack.
5695	-0.210526315789	If the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you, then the film is a pleasant enough dish.
5696	-1.36842105263	Ultimately, in the history of the Academy, people may be wondering what all that jazz was about ''Chicago'' in 2002. Zellweger's whiny pouty lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
5697	-3.31578947368	A seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer director Kurt Wimmer at the screenplay level.
5698	-0.210526315789	A pleasant and engaging enough sit, but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole.
5699	-0.631578947368	Its plot and animation offer daytime TV serviceability, but little more.
5700	-2.42105263158	A tired, unimaginative and derivative variation of that already shallow genre.
5701	-1.61111111111	Human Nature, in short, isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is; neither is it as smart.
5702	-0.888888888889	A film with a great premise but only a great premise.
5703	-1.27777777778	Instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence.
5704	-2.33333333333	Kirshner and Monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out bad act the other. (Kirshner wins, but it's close.)
5705	-2.5	A lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her.
5706	-1.55555555556	What started out as a taut contest of wills between Bacon and Theron, deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence.
5707	-1.88888888889	(Sam's) self flagellation is more depressing than entertaining.
5708	-3.5	An ugly, pointless, stupid movie.
5709	-1.66666666667	Simply put, there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn.
5710	-2.66666666667	The Master of Disguise represents Adam Sandler's latest attempt to dumb down the universe.
5711	-2.83333333333	This is an ungainly movie, ill fitting, with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be.
5712	-1.72222222222	Too silly to take seriously.
5713	-1.38888888889	The inevitable double  and triple crosses arise, but the only drama is in waiting to hear how John Malkovich's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line.
5714	-1.5	Everything's serious, poetic, earnest and    sadly    dull.
5715	-0.111111111111	I like it. No, I hate it. No, I love it...hell, I dunno.
5716	-2.88888888889	This mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy.
5717	-2.77777777778	It's clotted with heavy handed symbolism, dime store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long.
5718	-2.66666666667	A fifty car pileup of cliches.
5719	-3.27777777778	It's a stale, overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish. Not only is entry number twenty the worst of the Brosnan bunch, it's one of the worst of the entire franchise.
5720	-1.94444444444	What ultimately makes Windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story.
5721	-0.666666666667	As an actor's showcase, Hart's War has much to recommend it, even if the top billed Willis is not the most impressive player. As a story of dramatic enlightenment, the screenplay by Billy Ray and Terry George leaves something to be desired.
5722	-1.55555555556	A non Britney person might survive a screening with little harm done, except maybe for the last 15 minutes, which are as maudlin as any after school special you can imagine.
5723	-3.11111111111	It's not hateful. It's simply stupid, irrelevant and deeply, truly, bottomlessly cynical.
5724	-0.444444444444	Possibly not since Grumpy Old Men have I heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another.
5725	-2.22222222222	The drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love, lust, and sin couldn't keep my attention.
5726	-2.0	A rather tired exercise in nostalgia.
5727	-1.77777777778	The misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle, to be consumed and forgotten.
5728	-2.05555555556	Some Body often looks like an episode of the TV show Blind Date, only less technically proficient and without the pop up comments.
5729	-3.0	Bad Company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year, full of holes that will be obvious even to those who aren't looking for them.
5730	-2.27777777778	Predecessors The Mummy and The Mummy Returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to The Scorpion King.
5731	-1.2	A markedly inactive film, City is conversational bordering on confessional.
5732	-0.6	While kids will probably eat the whole thing up, most adults will be way ahead of the plot.
5733	-1.53333333333	Despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from Kathryn Bigelow, The Weight of Water is oppressively heavy.
5734	-1.86666666667	We've liked Klein's other work but Rollerball left us cold.
5735	-2.53333333333	They were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening, afraid of the bad reviews they thought they'd earn. They were right.
5736	-3.06666666667	It would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in Dragonfly, yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling, shamelessly manipulative and contrived, and totally lacking in conviction.
5737	-1.73333333333	Offers no new insight on the matter, nor do its characters exactly spring to life.
5738	-0.866666666667	Nohe has made a decent 'intro' documentary, but he feels like a spectator and not a participant.
5739	-2.66666666667	Apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret, but the only thing you'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it.
5740	-3.53333333333	A 94 minute travesty of unparalleled proportions, writer director Parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum.
5741	-2.46666666667	Guy gets girl, guy loses girl, audience falls asleep.
5742	-0.8	Too ordinary to restore (Harmon) to prominence, despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors, and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience.
5743	-0.933333333333	Stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of Ghost and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
5744	-1.53333333333	The weird thing about The Santa Clause 2, purportedly a children's movie, is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally.
5745	-2.06666666667	It's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish.
5746	-2.4	Contains the humor, characterization, poignancy, and intelligence of a bad sitcom.
5747	-3.06666666667	It doesn't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes. It still feels like a prison stretch.
5748	-2.6	Partly a schmaltzy, by the numbers romantic comedy, partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success    and entirely soulless.
5749	-1.13333333333	Ong chooses to present Ah Na's life as a slight, weightless fairy tale, whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character's blank faced optimism.
5750	-1.26666666667	The overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of ''7th Heaven.''
5751	-2.8	Just a Kiss is a just a waste.
5752	-2.66666666667	...this isn't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels.
5753	-2.93333333333	Frankly, it's kind of insulting, both to men and women. And it's not that funny    which is just generally insulting.
5754	-2.13333333333	As if Drop Dead Gorgeous wasn't enough, this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small town competition.
5755	-3.0	A wretched movie that reduces the Second World War to one man's quest to find an old flame.
5756	-1.86666666667	This is a remake by the numbers, linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie.
5757	-1.0	It's better than mid range Steven Seagal, but not as sharp as Jet Li on rollerblades.
5758	-1.93333333333	There's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long.
5759	-1.46666666667	The talk heavy film plays like one of Robert Altman's lesser works.
5760	-0.466666666667	As happily glib and vicious as its characters.
5761	-1.05555555556	One of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart.
5762	-1.66666666667	No better or worse than 'Truth or Consequences, N.M.' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic Mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a Western backwater.
5763	-2.55555555556	(MacDowell) ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is.
5764	-2.44444444444	I can imagine this movie as a b&amp;w British comedy, circa 1960, with Peter Sellers, Kenneth Williams, et al., but at this time, with this cast, this movie is hopeless.
5765	-1.61111111111	Talky, artificial and opaque...an interesting technical exercise, but a tedious picture.
5766	-1.05555555556	Kurys never shows why, of all the period's volatile romantic lives, Sand and Musset are worth particular attention.
5767	-1.38888888889	Almost nothing else    raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation    is one sided, outwardly sexist or mean spirited. And in a sense, that's a liability.
5768	-0.666666666667	It's easy to love Robin Tunney    she's pretty and she can act    but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices.
5769	-1.05555555556	If you've got a house full of tots    don't worry, this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then.
5770	-1.55555555556	The new film of Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard puts the 'ick' in 'classic.'
5771	-1.38888888889	Has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to, but its energy can't compare to the wit, humor and snappy dialogue of the original. If I want music, I'll buy the soundtrack. If I want a real movie, I'll buy the Criterion DVD.
5772	-0.944444444444	An unremarkable, modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title.
5773	-1.55555555556	Has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together.
5774	-1.55555555556	Writer director Stephen Gaghan has made the near fatal mistake of being what the English call 'too clever by half.'
5775	-2.22222222222	Seagal ran out of movies years ago, and this is just the proof.
5776	-2.5	The movie is so contrived, nonsensical and formulaic that, come to think of it, the day old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it.
5777	-2.44444444444	An awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating.
5778	-2.55555555556	The name says it all. Jackass is a vulgar and cheap looking version of Candid Camera staged for the Marquis de Sade set.
5779	0.333333333333	Children, Christian or otherwise, deserve to hear the full story of Jonah's despair    in all its agonizing, Catch 22 glory    even if they spend years trying to comprehend it.
5780	0.0	Pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle.
5781	-1.44444444444	...the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning.
5782	-1.77777777778	With Zoe Clarke Williams's lackluster thriller ''New Best Friend'', who needs enemies? Just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills.
5783	-2.27777777778	Hip hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity.
5784	-0.388888888889	An uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening.
5785	-1.27777777778	aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two drink minimum crowd, there's little to be learned from watching 'Comedian'
5786	-0.555555555556	A perfectly acceptable, perfectly bland, competently acted but by no means scary horror movie.
5787	-1.16666666667	The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water bound action over the land based 'drama,' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged.
5788	-1.94444444444	The problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage. The images lack contrast, are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable.
5789	-2.11111111111	Like a soft drink that's been sitting open too long: it's too much syrup and not enough fizz.
5790	-2.5	As the movie dragged on, I thought I heard a mysterious voice, and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light    the light of the exit sign. I have returned from the beyond to warn you: this movie is 90 minutes long, and life is too short.
5791	-1.2	There are some fairly unsettling scenes, but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer.
5792	-0.85	The Emperor's Club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world, but ...
5793	-1.95	In the end, The Weight of Water comes to resemble the kind of soft core twaddle you'd expect to see on Showtime's 'Red Shoe Diaries.'
5794	-1.2	A straight ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality.
5795	-2.35	Glizty but formulaic and silly...Cagney's 'top of the world' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel.
5796	-1.6	The re  enactments, however fascinating they may be as history, are too crude to serve the work especially well.
5797	-1.85	Is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo mo, double pistoled, ballistic pyrotechnic Hong Kong action aesthetic?
5798	-2.35	Once again, director Chris Columbus takes a hat in hand approach to Rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours.
5799	-1.6	Serving Sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time.
5800	-1.65	Too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like, this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot.
5801	-0.55	A well made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog.
5802	-3.05	The most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since Roland Joffé and Demi Moore's The Scarlet Letter.
5803	-1.75	The isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor.
5804	-2.0	As a movie, it never seems fresh and vital. It never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people. It labours as storytelling.
5805	-2.2	The Adventures of Pluto Nash is a whole lot of nada.
5806	-1.9	A really good premise is frittered away in middle of the road blandness.
5807	-1.6	Lawrence should stick to his day job. He's a better actor than a standup comedian.
5808	-1.5	Despite the fact that this film wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, it's still not a good movie
5809	0.2	A well made indieflick in need of some trims and a more chemistry between its stars.
5810	-2.6	I never thought I'd say this, but I'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies!
5811	-0.95	A film neither bitter nor sweet, neither romantic nor comedic, neither warm nor fuzzy.
5812	-2.55	Tiresomely derivative and hammily acted.
5813	-2.1	We never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together, and Michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest.
5814	-2.15	The plot grows thin soon, and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution.
5815	-2.2	Too bad Maggio couldn't come up with a better script.
5816	-2.65	Much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad.
5817	-1.8	Rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to The Rising Place that would set it apart from other Deep South stories.
5818	-2.15	At best, Cletis Tout might inspire a trip to the video store    in search of a better movie experience.
5819	-3.65	Witless, pointless, tasteless and idiotic.
5820	-1.95	Not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh, groan and hiss at.
5821	-2.05555555556	As plain and pedestrian as catsup
5822	0.277777777778	An improvement on the feeble examples of big screen Poke mania that have preceded it.
5823	-1.0	I know we're not supposed to take it seriously, but I can't shake the thought that Undercover Brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary.
5824	-1.44444444444	Your stomach for Heaven depends largely on your appetite for canned corn.
5825	-1.72222222222	A picture as erratic as its central character.
5826	-2.38888888889	Whatever satire Lucky Break was aiming for, it certainly got lost in the ''soon to be forgettable'' section of the quirky rip off prison romp pile. It's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
5827	-1.33333333333	The package in which this fascinating    and timely    content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic.
5828	-2.61111111111	Guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets. Some of the characters die and others don't, and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson, and, really, nobody in the viewing audience cares.
5829	-2.27777777778	Wildly incompetent but brilliantly named Half Past Dead    or for Seagal pessimists: Totally Past His Prime.
5830	-2.77777777778	Just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence...lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm.
5831	-2.44444444444	All the movie's narrative gymnastics can't disguise the fact that it's inauthentic at its core and that its story just isn't worth telling.
5832	-2.05555555556	Much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle, there isn't much there here.
5833	-1.61111111111	The film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive...
5834	-2.83333333333	For all its shoot outs, fistfights, and car chases, this movie is a phlegmatic bore, so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film The Sum of All Fears, starring Ben Affleck, seem downright Hitchcockian.
5835	-2.22222222222	This mild mannered farce, directed by one of its writers, John C. Walsh, is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago.
5836	-1.16666666667	A bit too eager to please.
5837	-2.72222222222	You'd be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous (than Leon).
5838	-1.77777777778	Kapur's contradictory feelings about his material result in a movie that works against itself.
5839	-1.94444444444	''the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store''
5840	-3.11111111111	Animated drivel meant to enhance the self image of drooling idiots.
5841	-2.66666666667	One scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud.
5842	-2.27777777778	'The Château is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot.'
5843	-1.72222222222	Meyjes focuses too much on Max when he should be filling the screen with this tortured, dull artist and monster in the  making.
5844	-2.0	Jacobi, the most fluent of actors, is given relatively dry material from Nijinsky's writings to perform, and the visuals, even erotically frank ones, become dullingly repetitive.
5845	-0.666666666667	Crudup's screen presence is the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy, existential exploration of why men leave their families.
5846	-0.722222222222	There is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best foreign film Oscar: Make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging, life affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture.
5847	-2.05555555556	Despite terrific special effects and funnier gags, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets finds a way to make J.K. Rowling's marvelous series into a deadly bore.
5848	-2.05555555556	An incredibly narrow in joke targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic.
5849	-3.33333333333	The only thing I laughed at were the people who paid to see it.
5850	-1.0	All of the elements are in place for a great film noir, but director George Hickenlooper's approach to the material is too upbeat.
5851	-1.8	The hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone.
5852	-0.933333333333	the phone rings and a voice tells you you've got seven days left to live. Then you get another phone call warning you that if the video isn't back at Blockbuster before midnight, you're going to face frightening late fees. O.K., not really.
5853	-2.86666666667	Possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio.
5854	-1.4	The film's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling.
5855	-2.13333333333	...a cheap, ludicrous attempt at serious horror.
5856	-2.0	Those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one.
5857	-1.6	Befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject
5858	-1.6	From beginning to end, this overheated melodrama plays like a student film.
5859	-1.46666666667	The movie would seem less of a trifle if Ms. Sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine.
5860	-1.6	It's just not very smart.
5861	-2.4	Like the excruciating End of Days, Collateral Damage presents Schwarzenegger as a tragic figure, but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions.
5862	-2.0	Imagine (if possible) a Pasolini film without passion or politics, or an Almodovar movie without beauty or humor, and you have some idea of the glum, numb experience of watching O Fantasma.
5863	-1.4	In trying to be daring and original, it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh.
5864	-2.26666666667	90 punitive minutes of eardrum dicing gunplay, screeching metal smashups, and flaccid odd couple sniping.
5865	-1.73333333333	Sadly, though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear, they can't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction.
5866	-1.73333333333	Never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance.
5867	-1.73333333333	After a while, Hoffman's quirks and mannerisms, particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue    things that seem so real in small doses    become annoying and artificial.
5868	-3.2	This wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful   no doubt, it's the worst movie I've seen this summer.
5869	-2.66666666667	It's drab. It's uninteresting. It squanders Chan's uniqueness; it could even be said to squander Jennifer Love Hewitt!
5870	-2.33333333333	The movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny Phonce and his several silly subplots.
5871	-1.6	This tale has been told and retold; the races and rackets change, but the song remains the same.
5872	-1.86666666667	A surprisingly flat retread, hobbled by half baked setups and sluggish pacing.
5873	-1.13333333333	Forget the Psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this won't seem like such a bore.
5874	-2.66666666667	A film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters. It's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter.
5875	-3.33333333333	New ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is.
5876	-1.53333333333	Lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward, static, and lifeless rumblings.
5877	-0.4	When cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy Giannini, Madonna gives her best performance since Abel Ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his Dangerous Game.
5878	-0.8	I suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject.
5879	-1.26666666667	The film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative.
5880	-1.8	An unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years.
5881	-2.72727272727	Only for young children, if them. Their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes.
5882	-1.86363636364	For all its violence, the movie is remarkably dull with only Caine making much of an impression.
5883	-1.77272727273	No matter how firmly director John Stainton has his tongue in his cheek, the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make.
5884	-2.31818181818	A sub formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer.
5885	-1.18181818182	The action is reasonably well done ... yet story, character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together.
5886	-2.90909090909	Several uninteresting, unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in ''Unfaithful.'' Why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me.
5887	-1.68181818182	Hill looks to be going through the motions, beginning with the pale script.
5888	-1.40909090909	Howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you'd swear he just stepped out of a Buñuel retrospective.
5889	-0.318181818182	The best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments.
5890	-2.27272727273	It's not a bad premise, just a bad movie.
5891	-2.54545454545	An already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti virus. If only there were one for this kind of movie.
5892	-2.31818181818	By the time the surprise ending is revealed, interest cannot be revived.
5893	-2.63636363636	The heedless impetuousness of youth is on full, irritating display in (this) meandering and pointless French coming of age import from writer director Anne Sophie Birot.
5894	-2.0	A peculiar misfire that even Tunney can't save.
5895	-1.5	Watching Queen of the Damned is like reading a research paper, with special effects tossed in.
5896	-3.27272727273	I can't remember the last time I saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in Extreme Ops.
5897	-1.68181818182	Too much of Nemesis has a tired, talky feel.
5898	-2.95454545455	I felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes.
5899	-1.86363636364	When Mr. Hundert tells us in his narration that 'this is a story without surprises,' we nod in agreement.
5900	-1.31818181818	Leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of Hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion.
5901	-3.45454545455	It is that rare combination of bad writing, bad direction and bad acting    the trifecta of badness.
5902	-2.45454545455	Each scene wreaks of routine; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense.
5903	-3.04545454545	A soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95 minute commercial for NBA properties.
5904	-3.13636363636	Borstal Boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking, the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy.
5905	-2.72727272727	The film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects    from the TV movie esque, affected child acting to the dullest Irish pub scenes ever filmed.
5906	-1.09090909091	works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making
5907	-3.63636363636	Crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since Valley of the Dolls.
5908	-2.13636363636	4Ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as Pokemon videos, but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly.
5909	-2.0	Feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime ... and, perhaps more than he realizes, just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work.
5910	-2.31818181818	Trailer park Magnolia: too long, too cutesy, too sure of its own importance, and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense &amp; about nothing at all.
5911	-2.4	Viewers of Barney's crushingly self indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it.
5912	-2.0	...its stupidities wind up sticking in one's mind a lot more than the cool bits.
5913	-1.33333333333	Sayles ... once again strands his superb performers in the same old story.
5914	-2.2	The Piano Teacher, like its title character, is repellantly out of control.
5915	-3.33333333333	I have to admit I walked out of Runteldat. I did go back and check out the last 10 minutes, but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes.
5916	-1.73333333333	The filmmakers lack the nerve ... to fully exploit the script's potential for sick humor.
5917	-0.733333333333	The film wasn't preachy, but it was feminism by the book.
5918	-2.0	... the same tired old gags, modernized for the extreme sports generation. There's already been too many of these films...
5919	-1.73333333333	Several of Steven Soderbergh's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist. Sadly, Full Frontal plays like the work of a dilettante.
5920	-1.6	Clockstoppers is one of those crazy, mixed up films that doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up.
5921	-0.6	Although bright, well acted and thought provoking, Tuck Everlasting suffers from a laconic pace and a lack of traditional action.
5922	-0.4	'The War of the Roses,' trailer trash style. Entertaining but like shooting fish in a barrel.
5923	-2.33333333333	Supposedly, Pokemon can't be killed, but Pokemon 4Ever practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over.
5924	-2.13333333333	White hasn't developed characters so much as caricatures, one dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else.
5925	-1.26666666667	When you resurrect a dead man, Hard Copy should come a knocking, no?
5926	-1.53333333333	Cattaneo should have followed the runaway success of his first film, The Full Monty, with something different.
5927	-1.53333333333	The film feels formulaic, its plot and pacing typical Hollywood war movie stuff, while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe.
5928	-3.6	This overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary. Hmmm...might I suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener?
5929	-1.66666666667	The makers of Mothman Prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies    a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad.
5930	-1.86666666667	Mr. Deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not so funny gags, scattered moments of lazy humor.
5931	-1.93333333333	How this one escaped the Lifetime network I'll never know.
5932	-2.4	Couldn't someone take Rob Schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person?
5933	-1.86666666667	One of these days Hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie, but until then there's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations.
5934	-1.4	For all its brilliant touches, Dragon loses its fire midway, nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion.
5935	-1.0	I have to admit that I am baffled by Jason X.
5936	-2.33333333333	A mean spirited film made by someone who surely read The Catcher in the Rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia
5937	-2.6	Instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid vid, we get an ugly, mean spirited lashing out by an adult who's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many Barney videos.
5938	-1.93333333333	This is a film living far too much in its own head.
5939	-3.06666666667	The umpteenth summer skinny dip in Jerry Bruckheimer's putrid pond of retread action twaddle.
5940	-1.8	National Lampoon's Van Wilder may aim to be the next Animal House, but it more closely resembles this year's version of Tomcats.
5941	-0.666666666667	The film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch Christian Right propaganda machine into national media circles.
5942	-2.86666666667	Dogtown is hollow, self indulgent, and   worst of all   boring.
5943	-3.13333333333	A movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes Battlefield Earth and Showgirls.
5944	-0.8	More of a career curio than a major work.
5945	-1.66666666667	It's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer, squad car pile ups and the requisite screaming captain.
5946	-1.53333333333	Cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness, not the man, and the results might drive you crazy.

5950	-0.933333333333	What's surprising about this traditional thriller, moderately successful but not completely satisfying, is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be.

5958	-2.13333333333	My precious new Star Wars movie is a lumbering, wheezy drag...

5960	-1.73333333333	Too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy, Vulgar is, truly and thankfully, a one of a kind work.

5962	-2.33333333333	Should have gone straight to video. It looks like an action movie, but it's so poorly made, on all levels, that it doesn't even qualify as a spoof of such.
5963	-2.8	It is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle age and older men drink to excess, piss on trees, b.s. one another and put on a show in drag.
5964	-2.53333333333	Consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director I admire.

5972	-1.45	Ends up offering nothing more than the latest Schwarzenegger or Stallone flick would.
5973	-1.75	The film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of America's indigenous people, but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart, one which it fails to get.

5979	-2.85	A pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between XXX and Vertical Limit.
5980	-1.45	Impeccably filmed, sexually charged, but ultimately lacking in substance, not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act.

5982	-1.25	While the mystery unravels, the characters respond by hitting on each other.
5983	-2.85	Britney Spears' phoniness is nothing compared to the movie's contrived, lame screenplay and listless direction.
5984	-2.7	Every sequel you skip will be two hours gained. Consider this review life affirming.
5985	-1.7	If the movie were all comedy, it might work better. But it has an ambition to say something about its subjects, but not a willingness.
5986	-0.7	The movie, while beautiful, feels labored, with a hint of the writing exercise about it.
5987	-2.25	Twenty three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career, Clint Eastwood's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him. Big time.
5988	-2.2	This heist flick about young Brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of Vin Diesel, Seth Green and Barry Pepper. It should have stayed there.
5989	-1.3	The film has a childlike quality about it. But the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass.
5990	-2.65	The most opaque, self indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine.
5991	-1.65	It's not a film to be taken literally on any level, but its focus always appears questionable.
5992	-2.3	Big Fat Liar is little more than Home Alone raised to a new, self deprecating level.
5993	-0.25	The movie is gorgeously made, but it is also somewhat shallow and art conscious.
5994	-1.65	The only time 8 Crazy Nights comes close to hitting a comedic or satirical target is during the offbeat musical numbers.
5995	-2.4	Loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes, twitchy acting, and general boorishness.
5996	-1.55	There's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling, but Brooms isn't it.
5997	-2.3	The story suffers a severe case of oversimplification, superficiality and silliness.
5998	-1.4	Chamber of Secrets will find millions of eager fans. But if the essence of magic is its make believe promise of life that soars above the material realm, this is the opposite of a truly magical movie.
5999	-1.4	Too clever by about nine tenths.
6000	-2.05	Has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children's home video, a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment, as long as 3 year olds find it diverting.

6004	-1.80769230769	Mendes still doesn't quite know how to fill a frame. Like the Hanks character, he's a slow study: The action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed.

6031	-2.15789473684	What remains is a variant of the nincompoop Benigni persona, here a more annoying, though less angry version of the irresponsible Sandlerian manchild, undercut by the voice of the star of Road Trip.

6039	-2.57894736842	To show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse    and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape    is overkill to the highest degree.

6043	-1.05263157895	Reno does what he can in a thankless situation, the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again, and Ryoko Hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that.

6065	-1.58823529412	At the one hour mark, Herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion.

6067	-0.941176470588	A simpler, leaner treatment would have been preferable; after all, being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something.
6068	-1.58823529412	The characters are based on stock clichés, and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility.
6069	-1.58823529412	Everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable.
6070	0.941176470588	Not the Great American Comedy, but if you liked the previous movies in the series, you'll have a good time with this one too.
6071	-1.29411764706	A domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches.
6072	-1.88235294118	Mr. Goyer's loose, unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way.
6073	-1.88235294118	The movie is so thoughtlessly assembled.
6074	-1.23529411765	Benigni presents himself as the boy puppet Pinocchio, complete with receding hairline, weathered countenance and American Breckin Meyer's ridiculously inappropriate Valley Boy voice.
6075	-1.58823529412	plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
6076	-1.70588235294	The end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump.
6077	-0.647058823529	For all the charm of Kevin Kline and a story that puts old fashioned values under the microscope, there's something creepy about this movie.
6078	-1.17647058824	I was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the Exxon zone, and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism.
6079	-1.82352941176	Producer John Penotti surveyed high school students...and came back with the astonishing revelation that ''they wanted to see something that didn't talk down to them.'' Ignoring that, he made Swimfan anyway
6080	-1.88235294118	Naipaul fans may be disappointed. Those who are not acquainted with the author's work, on the other hand, may fall fast asleep.
6081	-1.52941176471	Hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction, and even then his tone retains a genteel, prep school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound.
6082	-1.23529411765	If you're a Crocodile Hunter fan, you'll enjoy at least the ''real'' portions of the film. If you're looking for a story, don't bother.
6083	-2.58823529412	Full Frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters. By that measure, it is a failure.
6084	-1.52941176471	A baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard to swallow premise.
6085	-1.17647058824	An affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress producer and writer's previous collaboration, Miss Congeniality.
6086	-0.470588235294	Sometimes this modest little number clicks, and sometimes it doesn't.
6087	-0.352941176471	Like a pack of dynamite sticks, built for controversy. The film is explosive, but a few of those sticks are wet.
6088	-0.294117647059	Has its charming quirks and its dull spots.
6089	-1.70588235294	An admitted egomaniac, Evans is no Hollywood villain, and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he'd gone the way of Don Simpson.
6090	-1.64705882353	The audience when I saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times, and that's a bad sign when they're supposed to be having a collective heart attack.
6091	-2.55555555556	Everyone's to blame here.
6092	-1.66666666667	You get the impression that writer and director Burr Steers knows the territory ... but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools.
6093	-1.22222222222	Less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession.
6094	-2.05555555556	Rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them.
6095	-2.27777777778	It's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script, unimpressive acting and indifferent direction.
6096	-1.61111111111	A slight and obvious effort, even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits, age wise.
6097	-2.05555555556	Sex With Strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness. But what is missing from it all is a moral. What is the filmmakers' point? Why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery?
6098	-2.72222222222	You see Robin Williams and psycho killer, and you think, hmmmmm. You see the movie and you think, zzzzzzzzz.
6099	-2.66666666667	Downright transparent is the script's endless assault of embarrassingly ham fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a ''cooler'' PG 13 rating.
6100	-2.16666666667	The movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves.
6101	-1.94444444444	Formulaic to the 51st power, more like.
6102	-1.33333333333	Draggin' about dragons
6103	-1.16666666667	Howard and his co stars all give committed performances, but they're often undone by Howard's self conscious attempts to find a 'literary' filmmaking style to match his subject.
6104	-0.833333333333	A respectable but uninspired thriller that's intelligent and considered in its details, but ultimately weak in its impact.
6105	-1.27777777778	Jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot, but even he is overwhelmed by predictability.
6106	-1.61111111111	The movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time.
6107	-2.27777777778	Comes off more like a misdemeanor, a flat, unconvincing drama that never catches fire.
6108	-2.05555555556	Offers absolutely nothing I hadn't already seen.
6109	-2.77777777778	''Analyze That'' is one of those crass, contrived sequels that not only fails on its own, but makes you second guess your affection for the original.
6110	-1.27777777778	You might say Tykwer has done all that Heaven allows, if you wanted to make as anti Kieslowski a pun as possible. Suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled.
6111	-1.5	Complex, sinuously plotted and, somehow, off puttingly cold.

6114	-2.83333333333	Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures, and it looks as though Jay Roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab.
6115	-2.88888888889	Could as easily have been called 'Under Siege 3: In Alcatraz'...a cinematic corpse that never springs to life.
6116	-2.11111111111	In comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower class London life; despite the title...amounts to surprisingly little.
6117	-2.11111111111	Lame Sweet Home leaves no Southern stereotype unturned.
6118	-0.833333333333	Slow, dry, poorly cast, but beautifully shot.
6119	-2.44444444444	The jokes are sophomoric, stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious.
6120	-1.77777777778	Will give many ministers and Bible study groups hours of material to discuss. But mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film, which is often preachy and poorly acted.
6121	-1.0	In its chicken heart, Crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises.
6122	-0.666666666667	This long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted.
6123	-1.33333333333	The film is flat.
6124	-0.533333333333	The movie is a lumbering load of hokum but ... it's at least watchable.
6125	-0.733333333333	It's a boom box of a movie that might have been titled 'The Loud and the Ludicrous'...the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated.
6126	-1.6	An unbelievably stupid film, though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity.
6127	-1.73333333333	The first Fatal Attraction was vile enough. Do we really need the Tiger Beat version?
6128	-0.8	This Bond film goes off the beaten path, not necessarily for the better.
6129	-0.933333333333	The problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not.
6130	-1.73333333333	When the fire burns out, we've only come face to face with a couple dragons and that's where the film ultimately fails.
6131	-0.866666666667	It would work much better as a one hour TV documentary.
6132	-1.13333333333	The elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat.
6133	-1.13333333333	Anemic chronicle of money grubbing New Yorkers and their serial loveless hook ups.
6134	-1.46666666667	Simply doesn't have sufficient heft to justify its two hour running time.
6135	-1.73333333333	An unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas.
6136	-1.26666666667	Queen of the Damned as you might have guessed, makes sorry use of Aaliyah in her one and only starring role    she does little here but point at things that explode into flame.
6137	-1.53333333333	This toothless Dog, already on cable, loses all bite on the big screen.
6138	-1.6	It made me feel unclean, and I'm the guy who liked There's Something About Mary and both American Pie movies. Oh, and Booty Call.
6139	-1.8	Not only is it hokey, manipulative and as bland as Wonder Bread dipped in milk, but it also does the absolute last thing we need Hollywood doing to us: It preaches.
6140	-1.26666666667	It's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it's left a few crucial things out, like character development and coherence.
6141	-2.33333333333	Serving Sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it.
6142	-1.2	Director Roger Michell does so many of the little things right that it's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff.
6143	-1.4	A loud, low budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism 'urban drama.'
6144	-0.933333333333	The movie has a script (by Paul Pender) made of wood, and it's relentlessly folksy, a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions.
6145	-1.73333333333	A pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere, and just seems worse for the effort.
6146	-1.46666666667	At some point, all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy, vaguely silly overkill.
6147	-0.4	Despite some charm and heart, this quirky soccer import is forgettable
6148	-1.53333333333	Meyjes's movie, like Max Rothman's future, does not work.
6149	-1.0	What's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy.
6150	-2.13333333333	Schneidermeister... Makin' a fool of himself... Losin' his fan base...
6151	-2.6	An ambitious, serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance.
6152	-2.4	Not once does it come close to being exciting.
6153	-2.13333333333	A Frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick, Bartleby performs neither one very well.
6154	-1.06666666667	It plays like a big budget, after school special with a generous cast, who at times lift the material from its well meaning clunkiness.
6155	-1.4	There's something not entirely convincing about The Quiet American. And that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by Brendan Fraser.
6156	-1.93333333333	One of those strained caper movies that's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends.
6157	-1.4	Needed a little less bling bling and a lot more romance.
6158	-0.133333333333	The ending doesn't work ... but most of the movie works so well I'm almost recommending it, anyway    maybe not to everybody, but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right, and then step wrong.
6159	-1.8	It's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before.
6160	-1.53333333333	I'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about.
6161	-2.33333333333	Cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes.
6162	-1.33333333333	So brisk is Wang's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe.
6163	-1.26666666667	The bottom line, at least in my opinion, is Imposter makes a better short story than it does a film.
6164	-0.333333333333	Some elements of it really blow the big one, but other parts are decent.
6165	-1.46666666667	It is just too bad the film's story does not live up to its style.
6166	-1.93333333333	Unless you're a fanatic, the best advice is: 'Scooby' don't.
6167	-1.73333333333	A cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial.
6168	-1.6	For single digits kidlets Stuart Little 2 is still a no brainer. If you're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film, you'll need a stronger stomach than us.
6169	-1.6	Shreve's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen, and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less compelling soap opera.
6170	-0.733333333333	Contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether, in part because the consciously dumbed down approach wears thin.
6171	-2.53333333333	Nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid Americans will get a kick out of goofy Brits with cute accents performing ages old slapstick and unfunny tricks.
6172	-1.4	This is a film tailor made for those who when they were in high school would choose the Cliff Notes over reading a full length classic.
6173	-1.66666666667	The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie heads.
6174	-2.06666666667	A jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting, shooting or post production stages.
6175	-2.33333333333	A sad and rote exercise in milking a played out idea    a straight guy has to dress up in drag    that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply.
6176	-1.33333333333	Personal Velocity ought to be exploring these women's inner lives, but it never moves beyond their surfaces.
6177	-3.2	We hate (Madonna) within the film's first five minutes, and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground.
6178	-2.0	Sounding like Arnold Schwarzenegger, with a physique to match, (Ahola) has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation.
6179	-1.93333333333	Two big things are missing    anything approaching a visceral kick, and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all.
6180	-0.333333333333	A fascinating but choppy documentary.
6181	-2.85	Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company.
6182	-1.9	The doofus on  the loose banter of Welcome to Collinwood has a cocky, after hours loopiness to it. And as with most late night bull sessions, eventually the content isn't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is.
6183	-2.2	Too stagey, talky    and long    for its own good.
6184	-2.3	Apparently reassembled from the cutting room floor of any given daytime soap.
6185	-2.45	The sinister inspiration that fuelled DeVito's early work is confused in Death to Smoochy into something both ugly and mindless.
6186	-1.7	Despite Auteuil's performance, it's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road, where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug.
6187	-1.85	Director Boris von Sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through.
6188	-1.7	...little more than a well acted television melodrama shot for the big screen.
6189	-1.65	Never comes together as a coherent whole.
6190	-1.85	An unintentionally surreal kid's picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter species parody of a VH1 Behind the Music episode.
6191	-2.05	First, for a movie that tries to be smart, it's kinda dumb. And second, what's with all the shooting?
6192	-3.05	Don't even bother to rent this on video.
6193	-1.65	There is something in Full Frontal, I guess, about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them, but like most movie riddles, it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see.
6194	-1.75	This is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in September.
6195	-3.3	Not counting a few gross out comedies I've been trying to forget, this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes.
6196	-2.1	Plays like one long, meandering sketch inspired by the works of John Waters and Todd Solondz, rather than a fully developed story.
6197	-1.85	The film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers, and it lacks the novel charm that made Spy Kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences.
6198	-2.4	A mawkish self parody that plays like some weird Masterpiece Theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being.
6199	-0.9	An average B movie with no aspirations to be anything more.
6200	-1.6	Bartlett's hero remains a reactive cipher, when opening the man's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made.
6201	-0.8	Gibney and Jarecki just want to string the bastard up.
6202	-2.25	The plot is plastered with one Hollywood cliche after another, most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults.
6203	-1.15	Less worrying about covering all the drama in Frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie.
6204	-1.95	A film that suffers because of its many excesses.
6205	-2.05	Too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient.
6206	-1.75	In any case, I would recommend Big Bad Love only to Winger fans who have missed her since 1995's Forget Paris. But even then, I'd recommend waiting for DVD and just skipping straight to her scenes.
6207	-2.15	Depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen, then laughs at how clever it's being.
6208	-2.95	Nijinsky says, 'I know how to suffer' and if you see this film you'll know too.
6209	-2.15	'CQ may one day be fondly remembered as Roman Coppola's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
6210	-3.0	The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie.
6211	-1.93333333333	...the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank.
6212	-1.86666666667	Instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved major  character who shall  remain nameless, why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once?
6213	-1.8	It just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on (or be entertained by).
6214	-3.6	This action thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage.
6215	-2.2	MIB II is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything. That's because relatively nothing happens.
6216	-2.6	No amount of arty theorizing    the special effects are 'German Expressionist,' according to the press notes    can render it anything but laughable.
6217	-1.6	Blue Crush follows the formula, but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling.
6218	-1.46666666667	Boyd's screenplay (co written with Guardian hack Nick Davies) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to Guy Ritchie than the Bard of Avon.
6219	-2.0	There's not a spark of new inspiration in it, just more of the same, done with noticeably less energy and imagination.
6220	-1.73333333333	Jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin, inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder.
6221	-2.33333333333	A moving picture that does not move.
6222	-2.8	Ruh roh! Romething's really wrong with this ricture!
6223	-2.4	Its salient points are simultaneously buried, drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer director Roger Avary.
6224	-2.26666666667	I'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence: This erotic cannibal movie is boring.
6225	-2.53333333333	'God help us, but Capra and Cooper are rolling over in their graves.'
6226	-2.0	...an hour and a half of inoffensive, unmemorable filler.
6227	-1.33333333333	Is it a comedy? A drama? A romance? A cartoon?
6228	-1.73333333333	Ze movie starts out so funny, then she is nothing.
6229	-1.46666666667	Did the film inform and educate me? Yes. Did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 Armenia? No. And that is where Ararat went astray.
6230	-1.86666666667	It's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit.
6231	-1.13333333333	Has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim flam inventiveness.
6232	-1.66666666667	Eight Legged Freaks won't join the pantheon of great monster/science fiction flicks that we have come to love...
6233	-1.8	It gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions.
6234	-2.66666666667	Who, exactly, is fighting whom here? Ah, yes, that would be me: fighting off the urge to doze.
6235	-2.26666666667	A kilted Jackson is an unsettling sight, and indicative of his, if you will, out of kilter character, who rambles aimlessly through ill conceived action pieces.
6236	-2.53333333333	Contrived, awkward and filled with unintended laughs, the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster.
6237	-2.06666666667	Starts out with tremendous promise, introducing an intriguing and alluring premise, only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter.
6238	-1.93333333333	The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises.
6239	-1.53333333333	The only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured    to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering. Average, at best, I'm afraid.
6240	-2.93333333333	This movie is so bad, that it's almost worth seeing because it's so bad.
6241	0.375	A crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing.
6242	-1.83333333333	This movie feel more like a non stop cry for attention, than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment.
6243	-0.791666666667	Overall, it's a pretty mediocre family film.
6244	-1.625	Love may have been in the air onscreen, but I certainly wasn't feeling any of it.
6245	-2.58333333333	In addition to the overcooked, ham fisted direction, which has all the actors reaching for the back row, the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry.
6246	-2.54166666667	The very definition of what critics have come to term an ''ambitious failure.''
6247	-2.29166666667	It's as if De Palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.
6248	-2.83333333333	The movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh,' which is better than most of the writing in the movie.
6249	-1.08333333333	Worthy of the gong.
6250	-1.375	While certainly more naturalistic than its Australian counterpart, Amari's film falls short in building the drama of Lilia's journey.
6251	-1.91666666667	I found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays.
6252	-1.5	The soul searching deliberateness of the film, although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit, eventually becomes too heavy for the plot.
6253	-1.20833333333	The movie doesn't add anything fresh to the myth.
6254	-2.25	As inept as big screen remakes of The Avengers and The Wild Wild West.
6255	-1.875	Comes across as a relic from a bygone era, and its convolutions...feel silly rather than plausible.
6256	-1.70833333333	Moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured.
6257	-0.375	It's a very sincere work, but it would be better as a diary or documentary.
6258	-2.54166666667	Once one experiences Mr. Haneke's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience, one is left with a sour taste in one's mouth, and little else.
6259	-2.79166666667	Oops, she's really done it this time. That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has popped up with more mindless drivel.
6260	-3.58333333333	It's a loathsome movie, it really is and it makes absolutely no sense.
6261	-2.29166666667	A chiller resolutely without chills.
6262	-2.16666666667	For those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer generated effects, the new Star Wars installment hasn't escaped the rut dug by the last one.
6263	-1.04166666667	The director mostly plays it straight, turning Leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder.
6264	-2.79166666667	''Bad'' is the operative word for ''Bad Company,'' and I don't mean that in a good way.
6265	-1.54166666667	Though Frida is easier to swallow than Julie Taymor's preposterous Titus, the eye candy here lacks considerable brio.
6266	-0.666666666667	Drumline is    the mere suggestion, albeit a visually compelling one, of a fully realized story.
6267	-2.91666666667	The whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well.
6268	-1.16666666667	The film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry, but Ram Dass: Fierce Grace doesn't organize it with any particular insight.
6269	-2.25	Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse.
6270	-3.25	It's loud and boring; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert.
6271	-1.63157894737	Merely (and literally) tosses around sex toys and offers half hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes, most at women's expense.
6272	-0.526315789474	If you want a movie time trip, the 1960 version is a far smoother ride.
6273	-1.10526315789	Traffics in the kind of prechewed racial clichés that have already been through the corporate stand up comedy mill.
6274	-1.42105263158	The story is    forgive me    a little thin, and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed.
6275	-1.15789473684	...grows decidedly flimsier with its many out sized, out of character and logically porous action set pieces.
6276	-0.842105263158	I wish Windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story. This would have been better than the fiction it has concocted, and there still could have been room for the war scenes.
6277	-1.15789473684	Aggressive self glorification and a manipulative whitewash. Stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by Dustin Hoffman that is revelatory.
6278	-1.42105263158	None of the characters or plot lines are fleshed out enough to build any interest.
6279	-0.578947368421	As social exposé, Skins has its heart in the right place, but that's not much to hang a soap opera on.
6280	-1.42105263158	The whole film has this sneaky feel to it – as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product.
6281	-0.368421052632	There's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of Queen of the Damned, as its origins in an Anne Rice novel dictate, but generally, it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance.
6282	-2.47368421053	The only way to tolerate this insipid, brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers.
6283	-0.789473684211	This one is certainly well meaning, but it's also simple minded and contrived.
6284	-0.578947368421	Coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else.
6285	-2.36842105263	Bad and baffling from the get go.
6286	-1.47368421053	A series of immaculately composed shots of Patch Adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie.
6287	-1.26315789474	At a time when we've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is, Collateral Damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture.
6288	-0.947368421053	The impulses that produced this project ... are commendable, but the results are uneven.
6289	-0.894736842105	A well acted movie that simply doesn't gel.
6290	-1.26315789474	Like a can of 2 day old Coke. You can taste it, but there's no fizz.
6291	-1.47368421053	There's no excuse for following up a delightful, well crafted family film with a computer generated cold fish.
6292	-1.63157894737	Both the crime story and the love story are unusual. But they don't fit well together and neither is well told.
6293	-1.63157894737	It's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant.
6294	-2.05263157895	Other than a mildly engaging central romance, Hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind destroying cinematic pollution at worst.
6295	-1.26315789474	Jaglom offers the none too original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar.
6296	-1.63157894737	Outside of Burger's desire to make some kind of film, it's really unclear why this project was undertaken
6297	-1.84210526316	Was I scared? Only at the prospect of Beck's next project. Let's see, a haunted house, a haunted ship, what's next ... Ghost Blimp?
6298	-1.63157894737	A fragile framework upon which to hang broad, mildly fleshed out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming.
6299	-1.78947368421	By the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion, you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around.
6300	-0.315789473684	Since Lee is a sentimentalist, the film is more worshipful than your random E! True Hollywood Story.
6301	-1.26666666667	Wes Craven's presence is felt; not the Craven of 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' or 'The Hills Have Eyes,' but the sad schlock merchant of 'Deadly Friend.'
6302	-0.466666666667	Sunshine State surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology. But the cinematography is cloudy, the picture making becalmed.
6303	-2.53333333333	It's one long bore.
6304	-2.2	It gets old quickly. Watch Barbershop again if you're in need of a Cube fix  this isn't worth sitting through.
6305	-2.06666666667	It's leaden and predictable, and laughs are lacking.
6306	-2.53333333333	...a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone.
6307	-2.46666666667	Skip this dreck, rent Animal House and go back to the source.
6308	-2.53333333333	The movie is a desperate miscalculation. It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny, and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time.
6309	-2.13333333333	We just don't really care too much about this love story. In that setting, their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting.
6310	-2.0	The Transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull.
6311	-1.33333333333	Uzumaki's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse...
6312	-0.866666666667	'Men in Black II creates a new threat for the MIB, but recycles the same premise.
6313	-1.06666666667	Large budget notwithstanding, the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride. But this time, the old MIB label stands for Milder Isn't Better.
6314	-1.33333333333	Feels familiar and tired.
6315	-1.6	A retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by Martin Scorsese.
6316	-1.8	Instead of making his own style, director Marcus Adams just copies from various sources – good sources, bad mixture
6317	-1.06666666667	Criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes My Big Fat Greek Wedding look like an apartheid drama.
6318	-2.26666666667	A bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points.
6319	-2.2	A story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material.
6320	-2.13333333333	It's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as The Country Bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at Disneyland.
6321	-1.46666666667	Starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other Hollywood action cliches.
6322	-3.26666666667	Completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that I'm not sure could be a single iota worse... a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage.
6323	-2.0	An uneven look into a grim future that doesn't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on Philip K. Dick stories.
6324	-3.13333333333	Horrible.
6325	-2.73333333333	The disjointed mess flows as naturally as Jolie's hideous yellow 'do.
6326	1.73333333333	Bolstered by an astonishing voice cast (excepting Love Hewitt), an interesting racial tension, and a storyline that I haven't encountered since at least Pete's Dragon.
6327	-1.2	An authentically vague, but ultimately purposeless, study in total pandemonium.
6328	-1.4	Makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases.
6329	-1.2	As the sulking, moody male hustler in the title role, (Franco) has all of Dean's mannerisms and self indulgence, but none of his sweetness and vulnerability.
6330	-2.46666666667	The only thing to fear about ''Fear Dot Com'' is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film.
6331	-2.84210526316	It's too interested in jerking off in all its Byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience.
6332	-0.894736842105	'Synthetic' is the best description of this well meaning, beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high powered star pedigree.
6333	-1.68421052632	It concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between Chan and Hewitt.
6334	-1.84210526316	Impostor can't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels, fight off various anonymous attackers, and evade elaborate surveillance technologies.
6335	-1.68421052632	Judd's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller Smart Women, Foolish Choices for advice.
6336	-2.57894736842	The script has less spice than a rat burger and The Rock's fighting skills are more in line with Steven Seagal.
6337	-2.63157894737	This ill conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it.
6338	-1.57894736842	... there's a choppy, surface effect feeling to the whole enterprise.
6339	-1.78947368421	Doesn't get the job done, running off the limited chemistry created by Ralph Fiennes and Jennifer Lopez.
6340	-2.68421052632	A particularly joyless, and exceedingly dull, period coming of age tale.
6341	-1.94736842105	It's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of Janice Beard (Eileen Walsh) when her real life persona is so charmless and vacant.
6342	-2.15789473684	...it wasn't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film...It was the unfulfilling, incongruous, ''wait a second, did I miss something?'' ending.
6343	-2.89473684211	This is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you've been sitting still.
6344	-2.89473684211	Poor editing, bad bluescreen, and ultra cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action.
6345	-3.21052631579	It's super  violent, super serious and super stupid.
6346	-1.63157894737	So earnest and well meaning, and so stocked with talent, that you almost forget the sheer, ponderous awfulness of its script.
6347	-2.36842105263	Just a string of stale gags, with no good inside dope, and no particular bite.
6348	-1.84210526316	It's Splash without the jokes.
6349	-1.73684210526	The Château would have been benefited from a sharper, cleaner script before it went in front of the camera. Not to mention a sharper, cleaner camera lens.
6350	-2.84210526316	Shallow, noisy and pretentious.
6351	-2.78947368421	Morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed   he's taken one of the world's most fascinating stories and made it dull, lifeless, and irritating.
6352	-0.789473684211	Granddad of Le Nouvelle Vague, Jean Luc Godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide and seek.
6353	-2.94736842105	This loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience.
6354	-1.68421052632	It's better than The Phantom Menace. But unless you're an absolute raving Star Wars junkie, it isn't much fun.
6355	-2.84210526316	Philosophically, intellectually and logistically a mess.
6356	-1.63157894737	A standard police oriented drama that, were it not for De Niro's participation, would have likely wound up a TNT Original.
6357	-2.36842105263	Coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting, Circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera ish story.
6358	-1.89473684211	Hollywood Ending just isn't very funny.
6359	-1.78947368421	Though clearly well intentioned, this cross cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted.
6360	-1.84210526316	A technical triumph and an extraordinary bore.
6361	-1.35294117647	I can easily imagine Benigni's Pinocchio becoming a Christmas perennial. Coal isn't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings.
6362	-3.05882352941	Two hours of junk.
6363	-1.23529411765	Ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes, eye filling, wide screen production design and Joan's wacky decision to stand by her man, no matter how many times he demonstrates that he's a disloyal satyr.
6364	-1.05882352941	Self congratulatory, misguided, and ill informed, if nonetheless compulsively watchable.
6365	-2.23529411765	A clumsily manufactured exploitation flick, a style free exercise in manipulation and mayhem.
6366	-1.82352941176	The whole affair, true story or not, feels incredibly hokey... (it) comes off like a Hallmark commercial.
6367	-1.35294117647	What's missing is what we call the 'wow' factor.
6368	-2.05882352941	The nicest thing that can be said about Stealing Harvard (which might have been called Freddy Gets Molested by a Dog) is that it's not as obnoxious as Tom Green's Freddie Got Fingered.
6369	-1.47058823529	... Tara Reid plays a college journalist, but she looks like the six time winner of the Miss Hawaiian Tropic Pageant, so I don't know what she's doing in here ...
6370	-1.76470588235	The young stars are too cute; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative; the message is too blatant; the resolutions are too convenient.
6371	-1.23529411765	Normally, Rohmer's talky films fascinate me, but when he moves his setting to the past, and relies on a historical text, he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable.
6372	-1.05882352941	I highly recommend Irwin, but not in the way this film showcases him.
6373	-3.23529411765	It's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since I last walked out on a movie, but Resident Evil really earned my indignant, preemptive departure.
6374	-2.29411764706	This picture is mostly a lump of run of the mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office    or trying to win over a probation officer.
6375	-1.41176470588	Malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain. But the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure.
6376	0.529411764706	Though it goes further than both, anyone who has seen The Hunger or Cat People will find little new here, but a tasty performance from Vincent Gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary.
6377	-1.29411764706	A Blair Witch  style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera, with passable performances from everyone in the cast.
6378	-2.23529411765	Diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance
6379	-1.35294117647	It is too bad that this likable movie isn't more accomplished. The actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward.
6380	-2.0	The plot has a number of holes, and at times it's simply baffling.
6381	-2.82352941176	An ill conceived jumble that's not scary, not smart and not engaging.
6382	0.0	Brainless, but enjoyably over the top, the retro gang melodrama, Deuces Wild represents fifties teen gang machismo in a way that borders on rough trade homo eroticism.
6383	-1.76470588235	Gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop and start pacing.
6384	-1.23529411765	''What John does is heroic, but we don't condone it,'' one of the film's stars recently said, a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture's moral schizophrenia.
6385	-1.52941176471	Like coming into a long running, well written television series where you've missed the first half dozen episodes and probably won't see the next six.
6386	-2.11764705882	Its generic villains lack any intrigue (other than their funny accents) and the action scenes are poorly delivered.
6387	-2.47058823529	Dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material.
6388	-1.17647058824	Hard core slasher aficionados will find things to like ... but overall the Halloween series has lost its edge.
6389	-2.23529411765	Stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed.
6390	-2.64705882353	The story the movie tells is of Brian De Palma's addiction to the junk calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career.
6391	-1.125	Too many improbabilities and rose colored situations temper what could've been an impacting film.
6392	-0.6875	Generic slasher movie nonsense, but it's not without style.
6393	-1.5	With tiny little jokes and nary an original idea, this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool.
6394	-1.375	It sticks rigidly to the paradigm, rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived, well worn situations.
6395	-1.8125	Ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one?
6396	-2.0	Once Ice T sticks his mug in the window of the couple's BMW and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue, all credibility flies out the window.
6397	-1.375	The best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding. Quitting, however, manages just to be depressing, as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance.
6398	-2.5625	It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck, preferably a semi.
6399	-0.5	In the end, all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is.
6400	-2.3125	For most movies, 84 minutes is short, but this one feels like a life sentence.
6401	-0.5625	While Glover, the irrepressible eccentric of River's Edge, Dead Man and Back to the Future, is perfect casting for the role, he represents Bartleby's main overall flaw.
6402	-2.125	Shatner is probably the funniest person in the film, which gives you an idea just how bad it was.
6403	-1.5625	Tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident.
6404	0.0	As immaculate as Stuart Little 2 is, it could be a lot better if it were, well, more adventurous.
6405	-1.0	Simply a re hash of the other seven films.
6406	-2.0625	With jump cuts, fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics, Yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is. He fails.
6407	-0.375	I found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done.
6408	-2.1875	A very depressing movie of many missed opportunities.
6409	-2.4375	Goes on and on to the point of nausea.
6410	-2.3125	By turns numbingly dull witted and disquietingly creepy.
6411	-1.75	Boy, has this franchise ever run out of gas.
6412	-1.375	One problem with the movie, directed by Joel Schumacher, is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time.
6413	-2.1875	The comedy is nonexistent.
6414	-2.3125	...a bland, pretentious mess.
6415	-2.1875	It's a pedestrian, flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame.
6416	-1.375	A bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort.
6417	-2.375	It's not just the vampires that are damned in Queen of the Damned    the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate.
6418	-0.5625	If religious films aren't your bailiwick, stay away. Otherwise, this could be a passable date film.
6419	-2.1875	This is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience.
6420	-0.4375	The pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything.
6421	-2.05555555556	Stuffy, full of itself, morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about.
6422	-1.77777777778	It is most of the things Costner movies are known for; it's sanctimonious, self righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it.
6423	-2.0	Don't let the subtitles fool you; the movie only proves that Hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action.
6424	-1.27777777778	Chai's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack.
6425	-2.16666666667	To be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed.
6426	-1.61111111111	The director, with his fake backdrops and stately pacing, never settles on a consistent tone.
6427	-1.27777777778	One just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters.
6428	-1.38888888889	Instead of panoramic sweep, Kapur gives us episodic choppiness, undermining the story's emotional thrust.
6429	-1.33333333333	The director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in (the characters') misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it.
6430	-1.33333333333	This dubious product of a college spawned (Colgate U.) comedy ensemble known as Broken Lizard plays like a mix of Cheech and Chong and CHiPs.
6431	-2.22222222222	The movie doesn't think much of its characters, its protagonist, or of us.
6432	-0.777777777778	Super Troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres, existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early Zucker Brothers/Abrahams films, and the decidedly foul stylings of their post modern contemporaries, The Farrelly Brothers.
6433	-2.11111111111	...will always be remembered for the 9 11 terrorist attacks. After seeing the film, I can tell you that there's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it.
6434	-2.05555555556	Made me feel uneasy, even queasy, because (Solondz's) cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt.
6435	-1.05555555556	As a kind of colorful, dramatized PBS program, Frida gets the job done. But, for that, why not watch a documentary?
6436	-1.77777777778	With minimal imagination, you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub.
6437	-2.05555555556	Nights feels more like a quickie TV special than a feature film... It's not even a TV special you'd bother watching past the second commercial break.
6438	-1.77777777778	Although...visually striking and slickly staged, it's also cold,grey, antiseptic and emotionally desiccated.
6439	-1.44444444444	You can see where Big Bad Love is trying to go, but it never quite gets there.
6440	-1.94444444444	Friday After Next is the kind of film that could only be made by African Americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards African Americans.
6441	-1.27777777778	It's not as awful as some of the recent Hollywood trip tripe ... but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor.
6442	-2.5	The only thing ''swept away'' is the one hour and thirty three minutes spent watching this waste of time.
6443	-2.38888888889	One sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation. ... Stylistically, the movie is a disaster.
6444	-1.33333333333	The corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption.
6445	-2.38888888889	As violent, profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you've ever seen.
6446	-1.27777777778	Egoyan's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view, but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose.
6447	-1.0	Life or Something Like It has its share of high points, but it misses too many opportunities.
6448	-3.38888888889	This is a truly, truly bad movie.
6449	-2.44444444444	Despite bearing the Paramount imprint, it's a bargain basement European pickup. What's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up. Wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there
6450	-1.83333333333	Believability wasn't one of the film's virtues.
6451	-3.42105263158	Sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out that they'd need a shower.
6452	-1.94736842105	The Santa Clause 2's plot may sound like it was co written by Mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry.
6453	-0.947368421053	His best film remains his shortest, The Hole, which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive.
6454	-1.78947368421	Just another disjointed, fairly predictable psychological thriller.
6455	-2.36842105263	...stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier.
6456	-2.36842105263	Even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation cannot engage.
6457	-1.78947368421	Kung Pow is Oedekerk's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial arts flick, and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that.
6458	-1.78947368421	Busy urban comedy is clearly not Zhang's forte, his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy.
6459	0.368421052632	Not completely loveable    but what underdog movie since The Bad News Bears has been?    but certainly hard to hate.
6460	-1.52631578947	A movie that can't get sufficient distance from Leroy's delusions to escape their maudlin influence.
6461	-1.36842105263	It's Young Guns meets Goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds vs. greaseballs mob action comedy.
6462	-2.0	Louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected indie film mode, and brother Hoffman's script stumbles over a late inning twist that just doesn't make sense.
6463	-1.89473684211	The movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary, and on both sides it falls short.
6464	0.105263157895	The film is old fashioned, occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface.
6465	-2.21052631579	Can't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers? Try this obscenely bad dark comedy, so crass that it makes Edward Burns' Sidewalks of New York look like Oscar Wilde.
6466	-1.89473684211	In The New Guy, even the bull gets recycled.
6467	-0.789473684211	Largely, this is a movie that also does it by the numbers.
6468	-1.47368421053	On top of a foundering performance, (Madonna's) denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag.
6469	-1.68421052632	This is the first full scale WWII flick from Hong Kong's John Woo. He's not good with people.
6470	-1.89473684211	Patchy combination of soap opera, low tech magic realism and, at times, ploddingly sociological commentary.
6471	-2.15789473684	(Stevens is) so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits.
6472	-2.89473684211	So boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it.
6473	-2.15789473684	One of the more glaring signs of this movie's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from Ms. Spears.
6474	-2.73684210526	Hollywood Ending is the most disappointing Woody Allen movie ever. He has a great cast and a great idea. But the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work.
6475	-0.210526315789	... generically, forgettably pleasant from start to finish.
6476	-1.84210526316	It's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull.
6477	-2.10526315789	When not wallowing in its characters' frustrations, the movie is busy contriving false, sitcom worthy solutions to their problems.
6478	-1.94736842105	An overstylized, puréed mélange of sex, psychology, drugs and philosophy. Sometimes entertaining, sometimes indulgent    but never less than pure wankery.
6479	-1.94736842105	'Lovely and Amazing,' unhappily, is neither...excessively strained and contrived.
6480	-3.36842105263	Ringu is a disaster of a story, full of holes and completely lacking in chills. Ignore the reputation, and ignore the film.
6481	0.6	This one is a few bits funnier than Malle's dud, if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like Slob City reductions of Damon Runyon crooks.
6482	-1.66666666667	'It's painful to watch Witherspoon's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like Legally Blonde and Sweet Home Abomination, I mean, Alabama.'
6483	-1.53333333333	A plodding teen remake that's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists.
6484	-0.8	Trying to figure out the rules of the Country Bear universe    when are bears bears and when are they like humans, only hairier    would tax Einstein's brain.
6485	-2.0	Even in terms of the low grade cheese standards on which it operates, it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash.
6486	-0.0666666666667	Amidst the action, the script carries Arnold (and the viewers) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the ''other side of the story.''
6487	-1.33333333333	Rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue.
6488	-0.666666666667	It's a 100 year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by Elizabeth Hurley in a bathing suit.
6489	-0.933333333333	...one big laugh, three or four mild giggles, and a whole lot of not much else.
6490	-1.4	Too intensely focused on the travails of being Hal Hartley to function as pastiche, No Such Thing is Hartley's least accessible screed yet.
6491	-0.666666666667	Kenneth Branagh's energetic sweet and sour performance as a curmudgeonly British playwright grounds this overstuffed, erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child rearing in Los Angeles.
6492	-1.53333333333	Director Uwe Boll and writer Robert Dean Klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out, cannot overcome blah characters.
6493	-1.73333333333	Ms. Phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma, and is unable to project either Esther's initial anomie or her eventual awakening.
6494	-1.66666666667	The movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man.
6495	-1.0	A clichéd and shallow cautionary tale about the hard partying lives of gay men.
6496	-1.33333333333	The fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier.
6497	-1.2	A little weak    and it isn't that funny.
6498	-0.666666666667	While it is welcome to see a Chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion, Lan Yu never catches dramatic fire.
6499	-0.933333333333	The script boasts some tart TV insider humor, but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy.
6500	0.0	Despite the pyrotechnics, Narc is strictly by the book.
6501	-0.4	In both the writing and cutting, it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you. You end up simply admiring this bit or that, this performance or that.
6502	-0.333333333333	Cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust caked stagnation and labored gentility.

6508	-0.8	Includes too much obvious padding.
6509	-1.33333333333	There's no palpable chemistry between Lopez and male lead Ralph Fiennes, plus the script by Working Girl scribe Kevin Wade is workmanlike in the extreme.
6510	-2.93333333333	I'm not sure which half of Dragonfly is worse: The part where nothing's happening, or the part where something's happening, but it's stupid.
6511	-2.16666666667	Don't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross out comedy cycle.
6512	-3.16666666667	The only camouflage Carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public, to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers.
6513	-2.77777777778	Shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors...

6528	-2.11111111111	A horror movie with seriously dumb characters, which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy crawly bug things that live only in the darkness.
6529	-1.55555555556	It's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric, but never clearly seen or felt.

6533	-2.88888888889	The predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch, so stilted and unconvincing are the performances.
6534	-1.83333333333	Who are 'they'? Well, they're 'they'. They're the unnamed, easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid. They exist for hushed lines like ''They're back!'', ''They're out there!'' and ''They're coming!''
6535	-0.944444444444	Elegantly crafted but emotionally cold, a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level.

6538	-1.94444444444	I'm sure the filmmaker would disagree, but, honestly, I don't see the point. It's a visual Rorschach test and I must have failed.

6548	-1.93333333333	The adventure doesn't contain half the excitement of Balto, or quarter the fun of Toy Story 2.
6549	-0.933333333333	Essentially a collection of bits    and they're all naughty.
6550	-3.2	A mess. The screenplay does too much meandering, Norton has to recite bland police procedural details, Fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced, Hopkins looks like a drag queen.
6551	-1.66666666667	The screenplay by James Eric, James Horton and director Peter O'Fallon ... is so pat it makes your teeth hurt.
6552	1.26666666667	Before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy, Steven Shainberg's adaptation of Mary Gaitskill's harrowing short story ... is a brilliantly played, deeply unsettling experience.
6553	-1.06666666667	Solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that Soderbergh's best films, ''Erin Brockovich,'' ''Out of Sight'' and ''Ocean's Eleven,'' never were.
6554	-1.13333333333	Seems like something American and European gay movies were doing 20 years ago.
6555	-1.86666666667	In the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes, director Roger Kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of...outrageous gags.
6556	-2.4	You can see the would be surprises coming a mile away, and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer. Thumbs down.
6557	-2.66666666667	The characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite James Bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as The Usual Suspects.
6558	-2.13333333333	... del Toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy.
6559	-1.93333333333	The movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure.

6563	-0.866666666667	A movie in which laughter and self exploitation merge into jolly soft porn 'empowerment.'
6564	-0.666666666667	Occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive, a footnote to a still evolving story.
6565	-2.93333333333	If we're to slap protagonist Genevieve LePlouff because she's French, do we have that same option to slap her creators because they're clueless and inept?
6566	-1.4	Moretti plays Giovanni, a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy. Too predictably, in fact.
6567	-1.26666666667	Alternative medicine obviously has its merits ... but Ayurveda does the field no favors.
6568	-2.33333333333	This thing works on no level whatsoever for me.
6569	-1.0	It follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every Schwarzenegger film: Someone crosses Arnie. Arnie blows things up.
6570	-1.13333333333	Ice Age posits a heretofore unfathomable question: Is it possible for computer generated characters to go through the motions?
6571	-2.33333333333	An incoherent jumble of a film that's rarely as entertaining as it could have been.
6572	-1.94444444444	...they missed the boat.
6573	-2.05555555556	More dutiful than enchanting...terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat.
6574	-2.16666666667	Laconic and very stilted in its dialogue, this indie flick never found its audience, probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters.
6575	-1.83333333333	The comedy Death to Smoochy is a rancorous curiosity: a movie without an apparent audience.
6576	-2.11111111111	Barney's ideas about creation and identity don't really seem all that profound, at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three hour endurance test built around an hour's worth of actual material.
6577	-1.38888888889	Affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into, a role that Ford effortlessly filled with authority.
6578	-1.72222222222	Cinematic pyrotechnics aside, the only thing Avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude. It makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls    his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time.
6579	-2.66666666667	The narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys.
6580	-1.94444444444	Nothing more or less than an outright bodice ripper    it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows.
6581	-0.944444444444	A living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange. The fact that it isn't very good is almost beside the point.
6582	-2.05555555556	Feels less like a cousin to Blade Runner than like a bottom feeder sequel in the Escape From New York series.
6583	-1.61111111111	What might have been acceptable on the printed page of Iles' book does not translate well to the screen.
6584	-0.444444444444	If Oscar had a category called Best Bad Film You Thought Was Going To Be Really Awful But Wasn't, Guys would probably be duking it out with The Queen of the Damned for the honor.
6585	-1.83333333333	A poky and pseudo serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise.
6586	-1.22222222222	Mediocre fable from Burkina Faso.
6587	-0.111111111111	Fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative, but he does display an original talent.
6588	-0.666666666667	Since the movie is based on a Nicholas Sparks best seller, you know death is lurking around the corner, just waiting to spoil things.

6592	-1.16666666667	Nicholas Nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting Dickensian decency that it turned me (horrors!) into Scrooge.
6593	-2.5	Fear Dot Com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds.
6594	-2.05555555556	Full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references, Kung Pow! is the kind of movie that's critic proof, simply because it aims so low.
6595	-1.66666666667	May cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh so convenient plot twists.
6596	-1.88888888889	There are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations. Where's the movie here?
6597	-1.83333333333	A dark, dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires.
6598	-2.38888888889	Lacking substance and soul, Crossroads comes up shorter than Britney's cutoffs.
6599	-2.55555555556	Cassavetes thinks he's making Dog Day Afternoon with a cause, but all he's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill, didactic cartoon.
6600	-2.16666666667	Buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichés and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled Mr. Chips off the Old Block.
6601	-1.08333333333	Although sensitive to a fault, it's often overwritten, with a surfeit of weighty revelations, flowery dialogue, and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken.
6602	-3.33333333333	It's so badly made on every level that I'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it.
6603	-1.41666666667	Without non stop techno or the existential overtones of a Kieslowski morality tale, Maelström is just another Winter Sleepers.
6604	-1.66666666667	Nicks, seemingly uncertain what's going to make people laugh, runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy.
6605	-0.333333333333	'A' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full length comedy.
6606	-2.33333333333	If there's one thing this world needs less of, it's movies about college that are written and directed by people who couldn't pass an entrance exam.
6607	-1.79166666667	The script kicks in, and Mr. Hartley's distended pace and foot dragging rhythms follow.
6608	-2.20833333333	(E)ventually, every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism.
6609	-1.75	I am sorry that I was unable to get the full brunt of the comedy.
6610	-1.95833333333	No telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie.
6611	-1.33333333333	Looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen.
6612	-2.29166666667	In its best moments, resembles a bad high school production of Grease, without benefit of song.
6613	-1.875	Indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie.
6614	-1.58333333333	It's inoffensive, cheerful, built to inspire the young people, set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery, it's about as exciting as a sunburn.
6615	-1.83333333333	His comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude, calculated to provoke shocked laughter, without following up on a deeper level.
6616	-1.75	Christina Ricci comedy about sympathy, hypocrisy and love is a misfire.
6617	-1.70833333333	At times, the suspense is palpable, but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential.
6618	-2.66666666667	They should have called it Gutterball.
6619	-1.08333333333	Thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big, colorful characters. Mom and Dad can catch some quality naptime along the way.
6620	-1.875	It's too self important and plodding to be funny, and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic.
6621	-1.875	The best that can be said about the work here of Scottish director Ritchie ... is that he obviously doesn't have his heart in it.
6622	-1.95833333333	Less dizzying than just dizzy, the jaunt is practically over before it begins.
6623	-0.541666666667	Slick piece of cross promotion.
6624	-2.16666666667	Taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes.
6625	-2.04166666667	It believes it's revealing some great human truths, when, in reality, it's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile.
6626	-2.66666666667	It all drags on so interminably it's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time.
6627	-1.70833333333	Villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in Bibi's generic angst (there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows).
6628	-2.08333333333	(T)here's only so much anyone can do with a florid, overplotted, Anne Rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built in silliness of the whole affair defeats them.
6629	-1.83333333333	It's another video movie photographed like a film, with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism.
6630	-0.875	The techno tux is good for a few laughs, as are Chan and Hewitt, but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff, we can't recommend anything but a rental for The Tuxedo.
6631	-3.0	I got a headache watching this meaningless downer.
6632	-1.05263157895	Apart from dazzling cinematography, we've seen just about everything in Blue Crush in one form or the other.

6634	-2.21052631579	Detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor.
6635	-0.157894736842	Van Wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table, but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass a thons like Tomcats, Freddy Got Fingered, and Slackers.
6636	-1.0	The piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones.
6637	-1.47368421053	Very special effects, brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality can't hide the giant Achilles' heel in ''Stuart Little 2'': There's just no story, folks.
6638	-0.736842105263	The plot combines The Blues Brothers and Almost Famous (but with bears, and a G rating), with an excruciating dollop of Disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure.
6639	-2.78947368421	No way I can believe this load of junk.
6640	0.0	''Roger Michell (''Notting Hill'') directs a morality thriller.''
6641	-2.05263157895	It's dumb, but more importantly, it's just not scary.
6642	-2.52631578947	There is no pleasure in watching a child suffer. Just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame.
6643	-1.84210526316	The movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach. But is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition?
6644	-1.68421052632	Even with a green Mohawk and a sheet of fire red flame tattoos covering his shoulder, however, Kilmer seems to be posing, rather than acting. And that leaves a hole in the center of The Salton Sea.
6645	-1.78947368421	There's just no currency in deriding James Bond for being a clichéd, doddering, misogynistic boy's club.
6646	-3.10526315789	When the film ended, I felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while.
6647	-2.89473684211	Full of witless jokes, dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios, and saddled with a general air of misogyny
6648	-2.73684210526	The film's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations, nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style.
6649	-2.47368421053	The Iditarod lasts for days   this just felt like it did.
6650	-2.63157894737	It feels like an after school special gussied up with some fancy special effects, and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes.
6651	-2.47368421053	This movie is maddening. It conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought.
6652	-1.10526315789	Should have been someone else
6653	-1.36842105263	The film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete, as if the real story starts just around the corner.
6654	-1.47368421053	Why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures? Wouldn't one about their famous dad, author of Death in Venice, etc., be more valuable?
6655	-1.42105263158	The lower your expectations, the more you'll enjoy it.
6656	-0.736842105263	Rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign.

6658	0.263157894737	Even in this less than magic kingdom, Reese rules.
6659	-2.42105263158	Velocity represents everything wrong with ''independent film'' as a commodified, sold out concept on the American filmmaking scene.
6660	-2.68421052632	Just one bad idea after another.
6661	-2.2	Because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene, 'Swimfan' left me with a very bad feeling.
6662	-1.26666666667	Though Moonlight Mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving, the movie is too predictable and too self conscious to reach a level of high drama.
6663	-1.2	A movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle.
6664	-1.4	Corpus Collosum    while undeniably interesting    wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in.
6665	-1.66666666667	The last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming, but most of the movie is the same teenage American road trip drek we've seen before   only this time you have to read the fart jokes
6666	-1.66666666667	It's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable, and Shiner, starring Michael Caine as an aging British boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune, is certainly that.
6667	-1.53333333333	A by the numbers effort that won't do much to enhance the franchise.
6668	-2.13333333333	Involves two mysteries    one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters.
6669	-2.66666666667	Overall the film feels like a low budget TV pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube.
6670	-2.2	It's of the quality of a lesser Harrison Ford movie   Six Days, Seven Nights, maybe, or that dreadful Sabrina remake.
6671	-1.8	It appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen.
6672	-2.4	Despite all evidence to the contrary, this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie, the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on TV and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults.
6673	-3.26666666667	An unclassifiably awful study in self  and audience abuse.
6674	-2.26666666667	This movie is something of an impostor itself, stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work.
6675	-1.4	Hey Arnold! The Movie could have been made 40 years ago, and parents' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing.
6676	-2.53333333333	This one is definitely one to skip, even for horror movie fanatics.
6677	-2.66666666667	Excessive, profane, packed with cartoonish violence and comic strip characters.
6678	-2.6	Once the 50 year old Benigni appears as the title character, we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back.
6679	-0.333333333333	A working class ''us vs. them'' opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered.
6680	-1.46666666667	If the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of God,' it is far too self conscious to draw you deeply into its world.
6681	-1.4	There are simply too many ideas floating around    part farce, part Sliding Doors, part pop video    and yet failing to exploit them.
6682	-2.46666666667	It takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of Robert Forster, Anne Meara, Eugene Levy, and Reginald VelJohnson all in the same movie.
6683	1.06666666667	We haven't seen such hilarity since Say It Isn't So!
6684	-2.13333333333	Expect the same old, lame old slasher nonsense, just with different scenery.
6685	-2.0	The Cold Turkey would've been a far better title.
6686	-3.06666666667	The idea of 49 year old Roberto Benigni playing the wooden boy Pinocchio is scary enough. The reality of the new live action Pinocchio he directed, cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque.
6687	-2.06666666667	The ga zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures.
6688	-2.06666666667	Zaidan's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight.
6689	-2.86666666667	Try as I may, I can't think of a single good reason to see this movie, even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted, 'Thank you!' when Leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie.
6690	-1.13333333333	While it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus grouped into tedium, Yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold.
6691	-2.61111111111	It treats women like idiots.
6692	-1.11111111111	Though Catch Me If You Can isn't badly made, the fun slowly leaks out of the movie.
6693	0.0555555555556	Just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time.
6694	-1.66666666667	A valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the NBA.
6695	-0.722222222222	Impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances, but the movie doesn't quite fly. For starters, the story is just too slim.
6696	-0.5	So much facile technique, such cute ideas, so little movie.
6697	-1.66666666667	The experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not.
6698	0.166666666667	The film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes, Southern California locations and star power.
6699	-1.66666666667	It has its moments of swaggering camaraderie, but more often just feels generic, derivative and done to death.
6700	-2.16666666667	Almost gags on its own gore.
6701	-1.88888888889	How do you spell cliché?
6702	-0.777777777778	It's sweet, harmless, dumb, occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show.
6703	-1.83333333333	The moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess's home video of their baby's birth.
6704	-1.72222222222	While (Hill) has learned new tricks, the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film.
6705	-1.33333333333	In the real world, an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a résumé loaded with credits like ''Girl in Bar #3.''
6706	-1.66666666667	Too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped.
6707	-1.88888888889	Under 15? A giggle a minute. Over age 15? Big Fat Waste of Time.
6708	-2.27777777778	Hey Arnold! The Movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size, and it ain't pretty.
6709	-1.33333333333	Sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest.
6710	-1.88888888889	This is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever, but it's certainly not a champion   the big loser is the audience.
6711	-2.44444444444	You really have to wonder how on earth anyone, anywhere could have thought they'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this.
6712	-1.27777777778	In the end, we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love, Chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest.
6713	-2.16666666667	Chokes on its own depiction of upper crust decorum.
6714	-2.44444444444	Well nigh unendurable...though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry, it remains depressingly prosaic and dull.
6715	-1.94444444444	I thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as I slogged my way through Clockstoppers.
6716	-1.0	While much of the cast has charm    especially Allodi and Nolden    the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy.
6717	-0.944444444444	This directorial debut from music video show off Higuchinsky is all flash.
6718	-2.38888888889	Yes, Ballistic is silly. Unfortunately, it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies.
6719	-1.05555555556	The twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance, but twists are getting irritating, and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows.
6720	-1.0	The longer the movie goes, the worse it gets, but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes.
6721	-0.85	While it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records (Sugar Hill Gang, etc.), the constant referencing of hip hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences.
6722	-3.15	Not only unfunny, but downright repellent.
6723	-0.85	Care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up, but he never really embraces the joy of Fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace in rebellion found by his characters.
6724	-2.5	Forced, familiar and thoroughly condescending.
6725	-1.65	Does little more than play an innocuous game of fill in  the blanks with a tragic past.
6726	-1.8	K 19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap Hollywood tension.
6727	-2.15	Has a long and clunky ending ... which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience's awkward silence
6728	-1.7	A ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative, of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking.
6729	-2.6	Whaley's determination to immerse you in sheer, unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting.
6730	-1.5	Uncommonly stylish but equally silly...the picture fails to generate much suspense, nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions.
6731	-2.35	The entire movie is about a boring, sad man being boring and sad.
6732	-1.85	The plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain.
6733	-2.45	Confirms the nagging suspicion that Ethan Hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it.
6734	-2.65	Made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss.
6735	-1.5	It's a trifle of a movie, with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center.
6736	-1.25	Holden Caulfield did it better.
6737	-2.35	A synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness.
6738	-2.95	Oh come on. Like you couldn't smell this turkey rotting from miles away.
6739	-1.6	If it's seldom boring, well, it's also rarely coherent.
6740	-1.1	Simplistic fluff ball of whimsy.
6741	-1.25	Not exactly the Bees Knees
6742	-1.9	It does nothing new with the old story, except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they're being streamed over a 28K modem.
6743	-1.9	The kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated.
6744	-0.3	Makes for some truly odd, at times confusing, kids entertainment ... but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff.
6745	-2.9	The film contains no good jokes, no good scenes, barely a moment when Carvey's Saturday Night Live honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment.
6746	-1.05	Jacquot's rendering of Puccini's tale of devotion and double cross is more than just a filmed opera. In his first stab at the form, Jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically.
6747	-1.6	Chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama.
6748	-2.7	It's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak, and it has been unearthed and released now, when it has become even weaker.
6749	-1.35	This is nothing but familiar territory.
6750	-1.55	In execution, this clever idea is far less funny than the original, Killers From Space.
6751	-2.17647058824	One of the more irritating cartoons you will see this, or any, year.
6752	-2.05882352941	A broad, melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right.
6753	-1.88235294118	Too slow, too long and too little happens.
6754	-2.17647058824	The film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency. It's just filler.
6755	-1.05882352941	Sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot age with its less than objective stance.
6756	-3.05882352941	Utterly lacking in charm, wit and invention, Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film.
6757	-2.0	A hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the Mason Dixon line.
6758	-2.35294117647	Scores no points for originality, wit, or intelligence. It's a cookie cutter movie, a cut and paste job.
6759	-1.29411764706	They takes a long time to get to its gasp inducing ending.
6760	-1.70588235294	Barely gets off the ground.
6761	-1.64705882353	Even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering, Miller's hand often feels unsure.
6762	-1.29411764706	Pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life, but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer Adam Larson Broder and his co director, Tony R. Abrams, in their feature debut.
6763	-1.0	At its best, Queen is campy fun like the Vincent Price horror classics of the '60s. At its worst, it implodes in a series of very bad special effects.
6764	-1.23529411765	From the opening scenes, it's clear that All About the Benjamins is a totally formulaic movie.
6765	-2.17647058824	It takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as 'worse than expected,' but Ghost Ship somehow manages to do exactly that.
6766	-0.117647058824	On the bright side, it contains Jesse Ventura's best work since the XFL.
6767	-0.470588235294	Despite impeccable acting ... and a script that takes some rather unexpected (even, at times, preposterous) turns, Love is just too, too precious in the end.
6768	-0.882352941176	A TV style murder mystery with a few big screen moments (including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether).
6769	-0.823529411765	By getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters, I found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie.
6770	-1.88235294118	Too often, the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance.
6771	-1.17647058824	Dilbert without the right on satiric humor.
6772	-1.29411764706	Manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite.
6773	-3.05882352941	Do not see this film.
6774	-1.11764705882	Minority Report is exactly what the title indicates, a report.
6775	-1.70588235294	Delivers the same old same old, tarted up with Latin flava and turned out by Hollywood playas.
6776	-1.70588235294	If you believe any of this, I can make you a real deal on leftover Enron stock that will double in value a week from Friday.
6777	-2.35294117647	To call The Other Side of Heaven ''appalling'' would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be.
6778	-2.64705882353	In exactly 89 minutes, most of which passed as slowly as if I'd been sitting naked on an igloo, Formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey.
6779	-1.52941176471	If only the story about a multi million dollar con bothered to include the con.
6780	-2.17647058824	I'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here.
6781	-1.52380952381	Without the dark spookiness of Crystal Lake Camp, the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace.
6782	-2.90476190476	It's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after school special compiled in one place, minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication (and who knew they even had any?).
6783	-1.38095238095	While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills, suspense, and gore for video games, the movie really only succeeds in the third of these.
6784	-2.57142857143	For close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed, mostly inarticulate, hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one.
6785	-0.761904761905	To my taste, the film's comic characters come perilously close to being Amoses and Andys for a new generation.
6786	-2.09523809524	What the director can't do is make either of Val Kilmer's two personas interesting or worth caring about.
6787	-1.7619047619	In an effort, I suspect, not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted, it offends by just being wishy washy.
6788	-2.33333333333	It's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script, but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role.
6789	0.809523809524	Harland Williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex reassignment.
6790	-2.38095238095	...nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects.
6791	-1.2380952381	It's not that Kung Pow isn't funny some of the time    it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves, without all Oedekerk's impish augmentation.
6792	-2.09523809524	A very long movie, dull in stretches, with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction.
6793	-1.42857142857	Not an objectionable or dull film; it merely lacks everything except good intentions.
6794	-2.2380952381	A science fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left.
6795	-1.57142857143	Once (Kim) begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait and tackle metaphors, you may decide it's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard.
6796	-2.14285714286	The words, 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,' have never been more appropriate.
6797	-1.2380952381	What's next: ''My Mother the Car?''
6798	-1.7619047619	All the amped up Tony Hawk style stunts and thrashing rap metal can't disguise the fact that, really, we've been here, done that.
6799	-1.66666666667	A sequel that's much too big for its britches.
6800	-3.61904761905	So unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines.
6801	-1.61904761905	What was once original has been co opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian.
6802	-1.19047619048	A perplexing example of promise unfulfilled, despite many charming moments.
6803	-1.61904761905	For all the writhing and wailing, tears, rage and opium overdoses, there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution.
6804	-2.85714285714	A coarse and stupid gross out.
6805	-2.47619047619	a nightmare date with a half formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes.
6806	-1.95238095238	Doesn't offer much besides glib soullessness, raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... that raise the bar on stylized screen violence.
6807	-0.761904761905	There's something with potential here, but the movie decides, like Lavinia, to go the conservative route.
6808	-2.47619047619	It's one pussy ass world when even killer thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions.
6809	-0.52380952381	The stripped down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality, but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious.
6810	-1.14285714286	But the power of these (subjects) is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration, rather than contributing to a film's narrative.
6811	-2.41176470588	Rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment.
6812	-1.23529411765	Tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar.
6813	-2.41176470588	Paid In Full is so stale, in fact, that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from Brian De Palma's Scarface. That's a cheat.
6814	-1.52941176471	Harrison's Flowers puts its heart in the right place, but its brains are in no particular place at all.
6815	-2.94117647059	This re do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that, ironically, it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against.
6816	-2.41176470588	A string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity.
6817	-1.41176470588	The movie is Dawn of the Dead crossed with John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars, with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second.
6818	-1.64705882353	Basically a static series of semi improvised (and semi coherent) raps between the stars.
6819	-2.05882352941	Too restrained to be a freak show, too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral, too dull and pretentious to be engaging...The Isle defies an easy categorization.
6820	-1.64705882353	An unpredictable blend of gal pal smart talk, romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director John McKay can swallow.
6821	0.0	It's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic, the wife is patient, the kids are as cute as all get out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate, but short enough to make a dream seem possible.
6822	-2.29411764706	''The Time Machine'' is a movie that has no interest in itself. It doesn't believe in itself, it has no sense of humor...it's just plain bored.
6823	-2.17647058824	... a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it.
6824	-2.23529411765	A morose little soap opera about three vapid, insensitive people who take turns hurting each other. It's a feature length adaptation of one of those ''Can This Marriage Be Saved?'' columns from Ladies Home Journal...
6825	-1.35294117647	The film's essentially over by the meet cute.
6826	-1.05882352941	I'm sure if you're a Hartley fan, you might enjoy yourself... Me, I didn't care for it.
6827	-0.882352941176	It's about following your dreams, no matter what your parents think. Socrates motions for hemlock.
6828	-2.17647058824	The script isn't very good; not even someone as gifted as Hoffman (the actor) can make it work.
6829	0.352941176471	Walter Hill's pulpy, stylized boxing melodrama Undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in the ring match up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity.
6830	-2.05882352941	It has all the excitement of eating oatmeal.
6831	-0.764705882353	It's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong.
6832	-1.05882352941	Although there are several truly jolting scares, there's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at.
6833	-1.76470588235	I'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.
6834	-1.88235294118	Star Trek: Nemesis meekly goes where nearly every Star Trek movie has gone before. Wince inducing dialogue, thrift shop costumes, prosthetic makeup by Silly Putty and Kmart blue light special effects all conspire to test Trekkie loyalty.
6835	-1.35294117647	Like all abstract art, the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way, and    unless prewarned    it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all.
6836	-2.0	I don't mind having my heartstrings pulled, but don't treat me like a fool.
6837	-1.64705882353	...although this idea is ''new'' the results are tired.
6838	-2.76470588235	I'm guessing the director is a magician. After all, he took three minutes of dialogue, 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90 minute movie that feels five hours long.
6839	-1.70588235294	An unencouraging threefold expansion on the former MTV series, accompanying the stunt hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags, pranks, pratfalls, dares, injuries, etc.
6840	-2.23529411765	Its well of thorn and vinegar (and simple humanity) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks.
6841	-0.5	For all its impressive craftsmanship, and despite an overbearing series of third act crescendos, Lily Chou Chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam.
6842	-2.9	Don't be fooled by the impressive cast list   Eye See You is pure junk.
6843	-3.1	Not since Freddy Got Fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through.
6844	-1.4	The documentary does little, apart from raising the topic, to further stoke the conversation.
6845	-1.95	Plays like a volatile and overlong W magazine fashion spread.
6846	-2.15	A better title, for all concerned, might be Swept Under the Rug.
6847	-2.0	This movie seems to have been written using Mad libs. There can be no other explanation. Hilariously inept and ridiculous.
6848	-1.1	Vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them.
6849	-2.5	(A) shapeless blob of desperate entertainment.
6850	-1.45	Feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work.
6851	-3.1	Given how heavy handed and portent heavy it is, this could be the worst thing Soderbergh has ever done.
6852	-1.0	a by the numbers patient/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
6853	-3.25	A dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going.
6854	-2.2	Stealing Harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time.
6855	-1.0	Pretension, in its own way, is a form of bravery. For this reason and this reason only    the power of its own steadfast, hoity toity convictions    Chelsea Walls deserves a medal.
6856	-2.15	With the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by Cedric the Entertainer as Perry's boss, there isn't a redeeming moment here.
6857	-1.8	It's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense.
6858	-2.75	Movie fans, get ready to take off...the other direction.
6859	-1.3	(director) O'Fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen, but his skill at telling a story    he also contributed to the screenplay    falls short.
6860	-2.0	The intent is almost exactly the same (as The Full Monty). All that's missing is the spontaneity, originality and delight.
6861	-3.2	No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise.
6862	-2.35	Even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog, and Robert De Niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy.
6863	-1.75	There's too much falseness to the second half, and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull, ridiculous attempt at heart tugging.
6864	-0.75	It's not without its pleasures, but I'll stick with The Tune.
6865	-1.35	Miller is playing so free with emotions, and the fact that children are hostages to fortune, that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness.
6866	-1.5	Despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life, the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine.
6867	-1.25	More maudlin than sharp.
6868	1.05	This is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director Dario Argento (a producer here), but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic.
6869	-1.75	It's slow    very, very slow. It's not the ultimate Depression era gangster movie. That's pure PR hype.
6870	-1.65	Characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses, no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license Avary employs.
6871	-1.26666666667	Comes ... uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of The Bicycle Thief.
6872	-0.933333333333	Visually rather stunning, but ultimately a handsome looking bore, the true creativity would have been to hide Treasure Planet entirely and completely reimagine it.
6873	-1.8	Stealing Harvard is evidence that the Farrelly Bros.    Peter and Bobby    and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end, along with Green's half hearted movie career.
6874	-1.46666666667	There seems to be no clear path as to where the story's going, or how long it's going to take to get there.
6875	-0.866666666667	If you're a WWF fan, or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in A.I., you'll probably like Rollerball.
6876	-2.33333333333	I don't think I laughed out loud once. And when you're talking about a slapstick comedy, that's a pretty big problem.
6877	-1.73333333333	It's so mediocre, despite the dynamic duo on the marquee, that we just can't get no satisfaction.
6878	-2.33333333333	Slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy, but when it costs a family of four about $40 to see a film in theaters, why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead?
6879	-2.2	...turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock.
6880	-2.4	The notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy.
6881	-2.33333333333	My reaction in a word: disappointment. His last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images, but his latest has nothing going for it.
6882	-1.26666666667	It kinda works and qualifies as cool at times, but is just too lame to work or be cool at others.
6883	-1.53333333333	Sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects, not the least of which is Rebecca Romijn Stamos.
6884	-1.0	Intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story's least interesting subject.
6885	-1.53333333333	Feels haphazard, as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot.
6886	-2.13333333333	For each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses, many coming from the amazingly lifelike Tara Reid, whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout.
6887	-1.93333333333	In its own way, Joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a Luis Buñuel film without the latter's attendant intelligence, poetry, passion, and genius.
6888	-1.73333333333	I've always dreamed of attending Cannes, but after seeing this film, it's not that big a deal.
6889	-0.666666666667	The vintage is pure '87, with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message: Fatal Attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob; Unfaithful = don't if you're married to one.
6890	-0.6	A workshop mentality prevails.
6891	-2.46666666667	It cannot be enjoyed, even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick, primarily because it is dull. Yes, dull.
6892	-0.6	Pumpkin wants to have it both ways.
6893	-1.6	Director Uwe Boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback.
6894	-1.0	(W)hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism, Jane Goodall's Wild Chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands.
6895	-0.6	Outer space buffs might love this film, but others will find its pleasures intermittent.
6896	-2.86666666667	This piece of Channel 5 grade trash is, quite frankly, an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast.
6897	-1.0	An occasionally funny, but overall limp, fish out of water story.
6898	-2.8	A bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self importance...
6899	-2.13333333333	It's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters, hit and miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes.
6900	-1.93333333333	As A Rumor of Angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum, not even Ms. Redgrave's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality.
6901	-0.157894736842	New Best Friend's Playboy mansion presentation of college life is laugh out loud ludicrous.
6902	-2.52631578947	an appalling 'Ace Ventura' rip off that somehow manages to bring together Kevin Pollak, former wrestler Chyna and Dolly Parton. If any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future, that'll be much funnier than anything in the film...
6903	-2.0	The humor is forced and heavy handed, and occasionally simply unpleasant.
6904	-1.31578947368	Scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent; Perdition, meanwhile, reads more like Driving Miss Daisy than GoodFellas.
6905	-1.26315789474	While the script starts promisingly, it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target.
6906	-1.36842105263	As the latest bid in the TV to movie franchise game, I Spy makes its big screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small screen progenitor.
6907	-1.57894736842	This isn't even Madonna's Swept Away. This is her Blue Lagoon.
6908	-1.26315789474	The director knows how to apply textural gloss, but his portrait of sex as war is strictly sitcom.
6909	-1.57894736842	...the film suffers from a lack of humor (something needed to balance out the violence)...
6910	-1.21052631579	Burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast.
6911	-1.89473684211	An overemphatic, would be wacky, ultimately tedious sex farce.
6912	-2.31578947368	Has all the depth of a wading pool.
6913	-1.89473684211	This is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another, narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse, and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing.
6914	-1.78947368421	The so inept  it's surreal dubbing (featuring the voices of Glenn Close, Regis Philbin and Breckin Meyer) brings back memories of cheesy old Godzilla flicks.
6915	-2.10526315789	... the movie is just a plain old monster.
6916	-0.736842105263	If this disposable tissue has one wild card, it's John Turturro, who's simply fab as a Spanish butler with a foot fetish.
6917	-1.68421052632	One long string of cliches.
6918	-2.47368421053	Fancy a real downer? (Leigh) lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race.
6919	-2.0	Professionally speaking, it's tempting to jump ship in January to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller.
6920	-1.94736842105	Nelson's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film, leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle.
6921	-0.368421052632	Weaves a spell over you, with its disturbingly close up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger. But its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell.
6922	-1.84210526316	At once half baked and overheated.
6923	-1.26315789474	There's a solid woman  finding herself story somewhere in here, but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it.
6924	-1.42105263158	I still can't relate to Stuart: He's a mouse, for cryin' out loud, and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough.
6925	-1.36842105263	(Serry) wants to blend politics and drama, an admirable ambition. It's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one.
6926	-1.05263157895	By the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk,...actually pretty good. Of course, by more objective measurements it's still quite bad.
6927	-1.42105263158	The only entertainment you'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles – several of them.
6928	-1.47368421053	Sam Mendes has become valedictorian at the School for Soft Landings and Easy Ways Out.
6929	-0.315789473684	Exactly what it claims to be    a simple diversion for the kids.
6930	-1.89473684211	Its story may be a thousand years old, but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us?
6931	-1.4347826087	The problem with this film is that it lacks focus. I sympathize with the plight of these families, but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand.
6932	0.739130434783	A momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year.
6933	-0.739130434783	... think of it as American Pie On Valium.
6934	-2.91304347826	Dull, lifeless, and amateurishly assembled.
6935	-1.86956521739	Puportedly ''Based on True Events,'' a convolution of language that suggests it's impossible to claim that it is ''Based on a True Story'' with a straight face.
6936	-2.60869565217	...a plotline that's as lumpy as two day old porridge...the filmmakers' paws, sad to say, were all over this ''un bear able'' project!
6937	-2.5652173913	It's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel.
6938	-1.86956521739	With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood, Windtalkers is nothing but a sticky sweet soap.
6939	-0.782608695652	Some of it is clever, but it is never melodic/
6940	-1.52173913043	Better to just call it ABC Kiarostami. For AIDS and Africa are nothing more than part of the scenery.
6941	-2.52173913043	No aspirations to social import inform the movie version. This is a shameless sham, calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars.
6942	-1.26086956522	Manages to be somewhat well acted, not badly art directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling, touching or, yikes, uproarious.
6943	-1.0	This rather superficial arthouse middle brow film knows how to please a crowd, and that's about all it does well.
6944	-2.04347826087	It's clear the filmmakers weren't sure where they wanted their story to go, and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination.
6945	-2.73913043478	As vulgar as it is banal.
6946	-2.04347826087	You wonder why Enough wasn't just a music video rather than a full length movie.
6947	-1.86956521739	The film's tone and pacing are off almost from the get go.
6948	-1.30434782609	The talented and clever Robert Rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and didn't reserve enough for his second.
6949	-2.08695652174	More whiny downer than corruscating commentary.
6950	-0.391304347826	Tambor and Clayburgh make an appealing couple    he's understated and sardonic, she's appealingly manic and energetic. Both deserve better.
6951	-2.52173913043	Suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters, this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it's been packaged and sold back to us by Hollywood.
6952	-2.26086956522	Coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit.
6953	-1.69565217391	A wildly inconsistent emotional experience.
6954	-2.39130434783	Sit through this one, and you won't need a magic watch to stop time; your DVD player will do it for you.
6955	-1.17391304348	A sometimes tedious film.
6956	-1.86956521739	Teen movies have really hit the skids.
6957	-2.60869565217	There are plot holes big enough for Shamu the killer whale to swim through.
6958	-1.95652173913	...plays like somebody spliced random moments of a Chris Rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche riddled but self serious spy thriller.
6959	-3.26086956522	Nasty, ugly, pointless and depressing, even if you hate clowns.
6960	-3.21739130435	What is 100% missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy, an inkling of genuine wit, and anything resembling acting.
6961	-0.0625	does paint some memorable images ..., but Makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
6962	-0.3125	It uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color.
6963	-1.0	just not campy enough
6964	-1.5	The movie, directed by Mick Jackson, leaves no cliche unturned, from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting.
6965	-2.9375	It's everything you don't go to the movies for.
6966	-1.0625	Like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up: everything's in place but something's just a little off kilter.
6967	-1.3125	The affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to Demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy pie mystery scenario and the newfangled Hollywood post production effects.
6968	-2.125	For all its technical virtuosity, the film is so mired in juvenile and near xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when Godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking.
6969	-1.125	American Chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an Indian American would recognize. And the lesson, in the end, is nothing new.
6970	-3.5	It made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen.
6971	-1.6875	Due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director's brother, the film trails off into inconsequentiality.
6972	-2.9375	...plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes, playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments.
6973	-3.0625	So devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like XXX and Collateral Damage seem like thoughtful treatises
6974	-2.0	Combining quick cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time, Beck seems to be under the illusion that he's shooting the latest System of a Down video.
6975	-2.5	Dragonfly has no atmosphere, no tension    nothing but Costner, flailing away. It's a buggy drag.
6976	-1.1875	Works hard to establish rounded characters, but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them.
6977	-1.1875	The action switches between past and present, but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125 year divide.
6978	-2.75	Nonsensical, dull ''cyber horror'' flick is a grim, hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting.
6979	-3.0	Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics, Miramax should have hidden it from everyone.
6980	-2.625	Manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane.
6981	-1.0625	A great ensemble cast can't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar.
6982	-3.0	There ought to be a directing license, so that Ed Burns can have his revoked.
6983	-0.8125	The structure the film takes may find Matt Damon and Ben Affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a Good Will Hunting trilogy that was never planned.
6984	-1.1875	Whereas last year's exemplary Sexy Beast seemed to revitalize the British gangster movie, this equally brutal outing merely sustains it.
6985	-2.125	... a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the Linux cause.
6986	-2.625	Green might want to hang onto that ski mask, as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project.
6987	-2.6875	I can take infantile humor ... but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer's diapers.
6988	-1.125	There isn't nearly enough fun here, despite the presence of some appealing ingredients.
6989	-1.375	The tale of Tok (Andy Lau), a sleek sociopath on the trail of O (Takashi Sorimachi), the most legendary of Asian hitmen, is too scattershot to take hold.
6990	-1.4375	Directed in a paint by numbers manner.
6991	-1.0	A cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip off of (Besson's) earlier work.
6992	-2.375	A lackluster, unessential sequel to the classic Disney adaptation of J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan.
6993	-2.125	Samira Makhmalbaf's new film Blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness, although, it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
6994	-1.0	...routine, harmless diversion and little else.
6995	-1.5	Late Marriage's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep U.S. viewers off their feet.
6996	-1.0	This time Mr. Burns is trying something in the Martin Scorsese street realist mode, but his self regarding sentimentality trips him up again.
6997	-1.0	While there's something intrinsically funny about Sir Anthony Hopkins saying 'Get in the car, bitch,' this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer
6998	-1.75	It's hampered by a Lifetime channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth.
6999	-1.875	Let's hope    shall we?    that the 'true story' by which All the Queen's Men is allegedly ''inspired'' was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what's been cobbled together onscreen.
7000	-2.0	Is there a group of more self absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film? I don't think so. Nothing wrong with performances here, but the whiney characters bugged me.
7001	-1.375	There is very little dread or apprehension, and though I like the creepy ideas, they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill.
7002	-1.4375	If you've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies, what Sex With Strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever.
7003	-2.125	In the end, the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director Joe Carnahan.
7004	-1.875	Adults will wish the movie were less simplistic, obvious, clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized. But what are adults doing in the theater at all?
7005	-1.8125	Sticky sweet sentimentality, clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the WWII era Mississippi Delta undermine this adaptation.
7006	-2.375	It's another stale, kill by numbers flick, complete with blade thin characters and terrible, pun laden dialogue.
7007	-2.25	Every time you look, Sweet Home Alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn.
7008	-2.5625	Partway through watching this saccharine, Easter egg colored concoction, you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected TV show.
7009	-2.0	The overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future Hollywood sellouts.
7010	-2.0625	Portentous and pretentious, The Weight of Water is appropriately titled, given the heavy handedness of it drama.
7011	0.4375	A fitfully amusing romp that, if nothing else, will appeal to fans of Malcolm in the Middle and its pubescent star, Frankie Muniz.
7012	-1.4375	Jason X is positively anti Darwinian: nine sequels and 400 years later, the teens are none the wiser and Jason still kills on auto pilot.
7013	-2.1875	To say this was done better in Wilder's Some Like It Hot is like saying the sun rises in the east.
7014	-1.875	At the very least, if you don't know anything about Derrida when you walk into the theater, you won't know much more when you leave.
7015	-1.75	The actors are appealing, but Elysian Fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental.
7016	-2.25	As 'chick flicks' go, this one is pretty miserable, resorting to string pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting.
7017	-3.0625	The only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater.
7018	-2.125	There's no emotional pulse to Solaris. With an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting, Soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff.
7019	-1.5	It can't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller, a romance or a comedy.
7020	-1.0625	Denis O'Neill's script avoids the prime sports cliche, a last second goal to win the championship, but it neglects few others.
7021	-1.375	The character of ZigZag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him.
7022	-1.4375	One of those pictures whose promising, if rather precious, premise is undercut by amateurish execution.
7023	-1.6875	Serving Sara doesn't serve up a whole lot of laughs.
7024	-3.0	The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year, noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87 minute take.
7025	-2.875	With virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on, Chelsea Walls is a triple espresso endurance challenge.
7026	-3.3125	Deadeningly dull, mired in convoluted melodrama, nonsensical jargon and stiff upper lip laboriousness.
7027	-3.75	A misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip, young adult entertainment.
7028	-1.375	Like the Chelsea's denizens ... Burdette's collage form scenario tends to over romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste.
7029	-1.625	It's basically an overlong episode of Tales from the Crypt.
7030	-1.8125	The film makes a fatal mistake: It asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life.
7031	-2.125	Another in your face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues.
7032	-1.6875	Shaky close ups of turkey on rolls, stubbly chins, liver spots, red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere.
7033	-0.3125	I can't quite recommend it    it's too patched together    but I almost can; it's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it.
7034	-2.75	Complete lack of originality, cleverness or even visible effort
7035	-1.4375	Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed, haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn, neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining.
7036	-0.375	Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass, except that it seems to take itself far more seriously.
7037	-2.0	It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived.
7038	-2.4375	On the whole, the movie lacks wit, feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality.
7039	-1.4375	The story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships.
7040	-2.3125	Offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs...a sad sitcom of a movie, largely devoid of charm.
7041	-2.3125	Makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience.
7042	-1.6875	The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts.
7043	-1.5625	Although Huppert's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it, The Piano Teacher is anything but fun.
7044	-1.8125	It showcases Carvey's talent for voices, but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff.
7045	-3.875	Bad. Very bad. Stultifyingly, dumbfoundingly, mind numbingly bad.
7046	-1.4375	May reawaken discussion of the Kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen.
7047	-2.0625	If looking for a thrilling sci fi cinematic ride, don't settle for this Imposter.
7048	-1.625	Not really bad so much as distasteful: We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers.
7049	-2.5625	The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy, something from a Halloween that died.
7050	-2.1875	Davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is.
7051	-1.84	The Man From Elysian Fields is a cold, bliss less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves.
7052	-1.04	The messages of compassion and mercy are clearly, squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated Old Testament tale of Jonah and the Whale. Determined to be fun, and bouncy, with energetic musicals, the humor didn't quite engage this adult.
7053	-1.12	Historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit. But this films lacks the passion required to sell the material.
7054	-2.44	Long Time Dead? Not nearly long enough.
7055	-1.36	Nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle.
7056	0.68	A solid film...but more conscientious than it is truly stirring.
7057	-1.6	There's not enough here to justify the almost two hours.
7058	-1.76	The X potion gives the quickly named Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser beam eyes, which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays.
7059	-1.48	Perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form, but far too clunky, didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie.
7060	-1.12	Verbinski implements every hack artist trick to give us the ooky spookies.
7061	-0.16	McConaughey's fun to watch, the dragons are okay, not much fire in the script.
7062	-1.36	An unwise amalgam of Broadcast News and Vibes.
7063	-0.96	Skins has a right to yawp, and we have a right to our grains of salt.
7064	-1.28	Who needs love like this?
7065	-1.76	Hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole' miss in the way of story.
7066	-2.08	Returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters, Sandler, who also executive produces, has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy.
7067	-0.44	Exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise.
7068	-2.08	Trite, banal, cliched, mostly inoffensive.
7069	-2.2	Mattei is tiresomely grave and long winded, as if circularity itself indicated profundity.
7070	-1.88	It's not original, and, robbed of the element of surprise, it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks.
7071	0.12	Whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the CIA and a lost U.S. satellite, Hunter    starring Irwin and his American wife/colleague, Terri    is a movie children should enjoy.
7072	-0.64	It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment.
7073	-1.56	A sequence of ridiculous shoot 'em up scenes.
7074	-1.8	Nothing in Waking Up in Reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay.
7075	-2.6	I'm just too bored to care.
7076	-0.72	Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films, but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater.
7077	-1.88	Not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid.
7078	-1.52	As befits its title, this PG 13 rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the Snuggle Fabric Softener bear.
7079	-1.88	Attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy handed that they instead pummel the audience.
7080	-2.24	It all feels like a Monty Python sketch gone horribly wrong.
7081	-1.66666666667	Nervous breakdowns are not entertaining.
7082	-2.27777777778	Scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about.
7083	-1.61111111111	A beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel.
7084	-2.72222222222	Like being trapped at a perpetual frat party...How can something so gross be so boring?
7085	-3.33333333333	This is so bad.
7086	-1.0	Even film silliness needs a little gravity, beyond good hair and humping.
7087	-1.61111111111	I felt sad for Lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier, by Rohmer, for example.
7088	-1.38888888889	Prurient playthings aside, there's little to love about this English trifle.
7089	-2.5	This is a train wreck of an action film    a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs.
7090	-1.83333333333	The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark, decadent truffle.
7091	-1.0	It's played in the most straight faced fashion, with little humor to lighten things up. The heavy handed film is almost laughable as a consequence.
7092	-1.77777777778	Van Wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag.' At least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch.
7093	-1.83333333333	A disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the Bard, particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers.
7094	-1.83333333333	The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip. The end result is a film that's neither.
7095	-2.61111111111	Every nanosecond of the The New Guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable. Something like scrubbing the toilet. Or emptying rat traps. Or doing last year's taxes with your ex wife.
7096	-0.0555555555556	Scooby Dooby Doo / And Shaggy too / You both look and sound great. / But Daphne, you're too Buff / Fred thinks he's tough / And Velma   wow, you've lost weight!
7097	-1.5	Is the time really ripe for a warmed over James Bond adventure, with a village idiot as the 007 clone?
7098	-1.33333333333	There's enough melodrama in this Magnolia Primavera to make PTA proud yet director Muccino's characters are less worthy of Puccini than they are of daytime television.
7099	-1.33333333333	However it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs, young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust.
7100	-1.05555555556	The humor isn't as sharp, the effects not as innovative, nor the story as imaginative as in the original. But it could have been worse.
7101	-1.0	Some of their jokes work, but most fail miserably and in the end, Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny.
7102	-1.72222222222	Even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with Trouble Every Day; the movie lacks both thrills and humor.
7103	-1.66666666667	comes off like a rejected ABC Afterschool Special, freshened up by the dunce of a Screenwriting 101 class. ...Designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears, ''Crossroads'' instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns.
7104	-1.22222222222	it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
7105	-1.55555555556	It's just disappointingly superficial    a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating, involving character study, but never does more than scratch the surface.
7106	-1.77777777778	The title not only describes its main characters, but the lazy people behind the camera as well.
7107	-0.611111111111	Sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s, and starred Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn.
7108	-1.55555555556	Schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies, and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle aged character.
7109	-0.722222222222	Demands too much of most viewers.
7110	-2.33333333333	The story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured (and torturing) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on.
7111	0.933333333333	It should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit. So I just did.
7112	-2.26666666667	Shamelessly sappy and, worse, runs away from its own provocative theme.
7113	-2.26666666667	The Ring just left me cold and wet like I was out in the Seattle drizzle without rainwear.
7114	-2.46666666667	The film seems a dead weight. The lack of pace kills it, although, in a movie about cancer, this might be apt.
7115	-2.0	For anyone who grew up on Disney's 1950 Treasure Island, or remembers the 1934 Victor Fleming classic, this one feels like an impostor.
7116	-2.6	A clutchy, indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against... well, just stuff. Watching Scarlet Diva, one is poised for titillation, raw insight or both. Instead, we just get messy anger, a movie as personal therapy.
7117	-2.4	Meandering, sub aquatic mess: It's so bad it's good, but only if you slide in on a freebie.
7118	-1.93333333333	The ending is a cop out. What happens to John Q? I don't have an I Am Sam clue.
7119	-1.66666666667	Has the feel of an unedited personal journal.
7120	-1.66666666667	Remember when Bond had more glamour than clamor? No more.
7121	-1.66666666667	Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese, indeed.
7122	-2.46666666667	This charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make Jay and Silent Bob's Excellent Adventure seem understated.
7123	-1.06666666667	It doesn't quite deserve the gong, but there are more fascinating acts than ''Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.''
7124	-1.46666666667	The subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary    just not this one.
7125	-2.13333333333	... Hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves.
7126	-1.66666666667	Unlike his directorial efforts, La Femme Nikita and The Professional, The Transporter lacks Besson's perspective as a storyteller.
7127	-3.2	The overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than, say, ten... make that three minutes.
7128	-2.66666666667	Most of the supporting characters in Eastwood films are weak, as are most of the subplots. This one's weaker than most.
7129	-1.06666666667	Audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the Castro regime in less than saintly tones.
7130	-2.2	The film takes too long getting to the good stuff, then takes too long figuring out what to do next.
7131	-0.866666666667	You can practically smell the patchouli oil.
7132	-2.26666666667	To say Analyze That is De Niro's best film since Meet the Parents sums up the sad state of his recent career.
7133	-2.26666666667	The actors don't inhabit their roles    they're trapped by them, forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes.
7134	-2.66666666667	An often deadly boring, strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
7135	-2.66666666667	This film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience    just pure slapstick with lots of inane, inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions.
7136	-2.06666666667	Consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than Ali G
7137	-2.66666666667	Another week, another gross out college comedy  ugh.
7138	-0.4	Moderately involving despite bargain basement photography and hackneyed romance.
7139	-1.53333333333	There is no insight into the anguish of Heidi's life    only a depiction of pain, today's version of Greek tragedy, the talk show guest decrying her fate.
7140	-3.4	The editing is chaotic, the photography grainy and badly focused, the writing unintentionally hilarious, the direction unfocused, the performances as wooden.
7141	-3.22222222222	When (De Palma's) bad, he's really bad, and Femme Fatale ranks with the worst he has done.
7142	-1.48148148148	Tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films: Young is cool, and too young is too cool.
7143	-1.88888888889	I doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time Christmas really rolls around, but maybe it'll be on video by then.
7144	-2.07407407407	Uncertain in tone... a garbled exercise in sexual politics, a junior varsity Short Cuts by way of Very Bad Things.
7145	-1.03703703704	All's well that ends well, and rest assured, the consciousness raising lessons are cloaked in gross out gags.
7146	-2.2962962963	The only thing worse than your substandard, run of the mill Hollywood picture is an angst ridden attempt to be profound.
7147	-2.74074074074	If you think that Jennifer Lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry Ben Affleck, wait till you see Maid in Manhattan.
7148	-0.888888888889	Stars Matthew Perry and Elizabeth Hurley illicit more than a chuckle, and more jokes land than crash, but ultimately Serving Sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd.
7149	-2.0	It's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull, nerdy folks that inhabit Cherish.
7150	-2.03703703704	Culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character.
7151	-1.77777777778	In the end, Ted Bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac; there's no larger point, and little social context.
7152	-1.55555555556	... (like)channel surfing between the Discovery Channel and a late night made for cable action movie.
7153	-1.7037037037	A movie that, rather than skip along the Seine, more or less slogs its way through soggy Paris, tongue uncomfortably in cheek.
7154	-2.18518518519	Shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by Joaquin Baca Asay, the low budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity.
7155	-2.77777777778	Imagine a really bad community theater production of West Side Story without the songs.
7156	-2.62962962963	Soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and, subsequently, the movie itself.
7157	-2.55555555556	A one trick pony whose few T&amp;A bits still can't save itself from being unoriginal, unfunny and unrecommendable.
7158	-2.74074074074	The worst kind of independent; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
7159	-2.37037037037	It may be a prize winner, but Teacher is a bomb.
7160	-0.814814814815	The production values are up there. The use of CGI and digital ink and paint make the thing look really slick. The voices are fine as well. The problem, it is with most of these things, is the script.
7161	-0.814814814815	It's got its heart in the right place, but it also wilts after awhile.
7162	-1.66666666667	Proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie.
7163	-2.11111111111	Well, it does go on forever.
7164	-1.85185185185	This overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the Rush Hour crowd.
7165	-1.59259259259	Topkapi this is not.
7166	-1.96296296296	If Shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith, why didn't he just do it, instead of using bad sci fi as window dressing?
7167	-1.22222222222	Ethan Hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the Beatnik generation and it's all over his Chelsea Walls.
7168	-1.44444444444	Equal parts bodice ripper and plodding costume drama.
7169	-1.85185185185	I'm not suggesting that you actually see it, unless you're the kind of person who has seen every Wim Wenders film of the '70s.
7170	-2.51851851852	While the film misfires at every level, the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy.
7171	1.66666666667	If you liked the 1982 film then, you'll still like it now.
7172	-1.44444444444	A 93 minute condensation of a 26 episode TV series, with all of the pitfalls of such you'd expect.
7173	-1.16666666667	Guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things. She lists ingredients, but never mixes and stirs.
7174	-1.55555555556	Audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far    and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school.
7175	-2.38888888889	To imagine the life of Harry Potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized Woody Allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is Kung Pow: Enter the Fist.
7176	-1.27777777778	It delivers some chills and sustained unease, but flounders in its quest for Deeper Meaning.
7177	-2.05555555556	Credibility levels are low and character development a non starter.
7178	-1.5	I would have preferred a transfer down the hall to Mr. Holland's class for the music, or to Robin Williams's lecture so I could listen to a teacher with humor, passion, and verve.
7179	-1.27777777778	For the most part, the ingredients are there. But an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents Nettelbeck's film from coming together.
7180	-1.27777777778	An earnest, heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives. It's also heavy handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views.
7181	-1.94444444444	A mawkish, implausible platonic romance that makes Chaplin's City Lights seem dispassionate by comparison.
7182	-0.666666666667	Yes, one enjoys seeing Joan grow from awkward young woman to strong, determined monarch, but her love for the philandering Philip only diminishes her stature.
7183	-1.61111111111	It's a film that hinges on its casting, and Glover really doesn't fit the part.
7184	-2.66666666667	This is a throwaway, junk food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself.
7185	-2.72222222222	...with the candy like taste of it fading faster than 25 cent bubble gum, I realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time. It's a trifle.
7186	-0.777777777778	Literally nothing in The Pool is new, but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes.
7187	-2.16666666667	Arguably the year's silliest and most incoherent movie.
7188	-1.05555555556	Anyway, for one reason or another, Crush turns into a dire drama partway through. After that, it just gets stupid and maudlin. Too bad, but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances, it's not a total loss.
7189	-1.66666666667	Chao was Chen Kaige's assistant for years in China. He has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about.
7190	-0.833333333333	A mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world.
7191	-3.11111111111	The film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously.
7192	-2.66666666667	Marries the amateurishness of The Blair Witch Project with the illogic of Series 7: The Contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie.
7193	-3.0	The Piano Teacher is the sort of movie that discourages American audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film.
7194	-1.83333333333	If it's another regurgitated action movie you're after, there's no better film than Half Past Dead.
7195	-1.44444444444	So what is the point? Lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland, basically.
7196	-1.72222222222	This is junk food cinema at its greasiest.
7197	-1.05555555556	When it's all wet, Blue Crush is highly enjoyable. When it's on dry land, though, this surfer girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper.
7198	-2.88888888889	Most new movies have a bright sheen. Some, like Ballistic, arrive stillborn... looking like the beaten, well worn video box cover of seven years into the future.
7199	-1.22222222222	The story is naturally poignant, but first time screenwriter Paul Pender overloads it with sugary bits of business.
7200	-1.27777777778	You see Robert De Niro singing   and dancing to   West Side Story show tunes. Choose your reaction: A.) That sure is funny! B.) That sure is pathetic!
7201	-2.74074074074	A sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards.
7202	-1.40740740741	This dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old Hollywood saw: Evil is interesting and good is boring.
7203	-1.88888888889	Before long, the film starts playing like General Hospital crossed with a Saturday Night Live spoof of Dog Day Afternoon.
7204	-1.44444444444	The charms of willful eccentricity, at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay, are beginning to wear a bit thin.
7205	-1.62962962963	Instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story, the film's more determined to become the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre. But what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul?
7206	-2.03703703704	A silly, self indulgent film about a silly, self indulgent filmmaker.
7207	-1.07407407407	Scarlet Diva has a voyeuristic tug, but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be.
7208	-2.07407407407	The character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time, and Clayburgh doesn't always improve the over the top mix.
7209	-2.7037037037	Flashy, pretentious and as impenetrable as Morvern's thick, working class Scottish accent.
7210	-2.11111111111	A battle between bug eye theatre and dead eye matinee.
7211	-2.37037037037	The movie is virtually without context    journalistic or historical. What's worse is that Pelosi knows it.
7212	-1.03703703704	... instead go rent ''Shakes The Clown'', a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great Robin Williams performance.
7213	-2.44444444444	Lame, haphazard teen comedy.
7214	-1.74074074074	It's the kind of movie that ends up festooning U.S. art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in French (well, mostly) with English subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that.
7215	-3.18518518519	This miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty, believing Flatbush machismo will get it through.
7216	-1.96296296296	Expect to be reminded of other, better films, especially Seven, which director William Malone slavishly copies.
7217	-1.81481481481	Nair stuffs the film with dancing, henna, ornamentation, and group song, but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera.
7218	-2.0	It's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that Hollywood isn't laughing with us, folks. It's laughing at us.
7219	-1.37037037037	Might have been better off as a documentary, with less of Mr. Eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage.
7220	-2.14814814815	Every good actor needs to do his or her own Hamlet. For Benigni it wasn't Shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but Pinocchio. It might as well have been Problem Child IV.
7221	-2.07407407407	Arnold's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces.
7222	-1.0	Both awful and appealing.
7223	-1.88888888889	The lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome    the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary.
7224	-1.51851851852	Nothing plot wise is worth e mailing home about.
7225	-1.33333333333	We are left with a superficial snapshot that, however engaging, is insufficiently enlightening and inviting.
7226	-1.25925925926	Helmer DeVito...attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics, payola, vice, murder, kids' TV and revenge.
7227	-1.7037037037	It wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $7.00.
7228	-3.62962962963	I hated every minute of it.
7229	-1.85185185185	(T)hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously, and the Stepford Wives mentality doesn't work in a modern context.
7230	-1.77777777778	Obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of Hey Arnold! The Movie will reach far beyond its core demographic.
7231	-1.16666666667	There's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the Disney classic, and even that of the excellent 1934 MGM version.
7232	-0.444444444444	A simple, sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting, but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within.
7233	-0.388888888889	Roger Michell, who did an appealing job directing Persuasion and Notting Hill in England, gets too artsy in his American debut.
7234	-0.888888888889	There is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt Seagal's character ... performs is shot from behind, as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double.
7235	-1.33333333333	Anthony Hopkins? Big deal! We've already seen the prequel to The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal    and it was better the first time.
7236	-1.05555555556	Ostensibly celebrates middle aged girl power, even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic, dysfunctional and destructive.
7237	-1.44444444444	If this is an example of the type of project that Robert Redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to, then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films.
7238	-1.44444444444	Pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless Todd Solondzian satire and callow student film.
7239	-1.27777777778	Not so much funny as aggressively sitcom cute, it's full of throwaway one liners, not quite jokes, and a determined TV amiability that Allen personifies.
7240	-1.0	It's not that Waiting For Happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. It's just incredibly dull.
7241	-1.38888888889	The sad thing about Knockaround Guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is.
7242	-1.88888888889	A cumbersome and cliche ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man.
7243	-0.5	Director Ferzan Ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group, who live in the same apartment building. But he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person.
7244	-1.11111111111	Egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement, and, if you'll excuse a little critical heresy, too intellectually ambitious.
7245	-0.222222222222	It wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film, but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy.
7246	-1.16666666667	Despite apparent motives to the contrary, it ends up being, like (Seinfeld's) revered TV show, about pretty much nothing.
7247	-1.22222222222	Shadyac shoots his film like an M. Night Shyamalan movie, and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace; he just forgot to add any genuine tension.
7248	-1.33333333333	Plays less like a coming of age romance than an infomercial.
7249	-1.05555555556	There are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about, but not enough to make this anything more than another big budget bust.
7250	-1.38888888889	The story's so preposterous that I didn't believe it for a second, despite the best efforts of everyone involved.
7251	-0.777777777778	I've heard that the fans of the first Men in Black have come away hating the second one. I wonder why. They felt like the same movie to me.
7252	-1.22222222222	Despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry, Witherspoon is just too dialed up to be America's Sweetheart.
7253	-0.722222222222	An ultra low budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent.
7254	-0.666666666667	Birot is a competent enough filmmaker, but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it.
7255	-1.16666666667	De Niro and McDormand give solid performances, but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to create interest.
7256	-1.38888888889	Even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy... even for Disney.
7257	-1.05555555556	That is essentially what's missing from Blackboards    the sense of something bigger, some ultimate point.
7258	-1.66666666667	A compendium of Solondz's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes.
7259	-1.72222222222	If the title is a Jeopardy question, then the answer might be ''How does Steven Seagal come across these days?'' or maybe ''How will you feel after an 88 minute rip off of The Rock with action confined to slo mo gun firing and random glass shattering?''
7260	-1.94444444444	It is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling (and an uneasy alliance, at that).
7261	-0.944444444444	The story is familiar from its many predecessors; like them, it eventually culminates in the not exactly  stunning insight that crime doesn't pay.
7262	-3.44444444444	You'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot. You'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus.
7263	-1.88888888889	Dissing a Bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid, but when it has the temerity to run over two hours, you feel like winding up with a kick.
7264	-1.88888888889	Ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham fisted, from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact Amber is such a joke.
7265	0.0555555555556	Flat, but with a revelatory performance by Michelle Williams.
7266	-1.11111111111	Little more than a frothy vanity project.
7267	-1.5	The film goes from being an unusual sci fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending.
7268	-1.16666666667	Verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action, tedium for thrills.
7269	-1.77777777778	For all its surface frenzy, High Crimes should be charged with loitering    so much on view, so little to offer.
7270	-2.27777777778	The Sum of All Fears is almost impossible to follow    and there's something cringe inducing about seeing an American football stadium nuked as pop entertainment.
7271	-0.944444444444	Alex Nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real life, big budget NC 17 version of Tank Girl.
7272	-2.16666666667	The title Trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra manipulative thriller.
7273	-2.44444444444	The appeal of the vulgar, sexist, racist humour went over my head or    considering just how low brow it is    perhaps it snuck under my feet.
7274	-1.72222222222	The story really has no place to go since Simone is not real  she can't provide any conflict.
7275	-1.77777777778	IHOPs don't pile on this much syrup.
7276	1.05555555556	For the most part, I Spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of Murphy's better performances in one of his lesser praised movies.
7277	-3.33333333333	focuses on Joan's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with Spanish inquisitions about her ''madness'' so much that I became mad that I wasted 123 minutes and $9.50 on this 21st century torture device.
7278	-2.77777777778	This series should have died long ago, but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last James Bond movie.
7279	-2.16666666667	A bit of an unwieldy mess.
7280	-1.22222222222	With a story as bizarre and mysterious as this, you don't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual Broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door.
7281	-1.66666666667	The filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point, unless it's that life stinks, especially for sensitive married women who really love other women.
7282	-1.05555555556	The movie feels like it's going to be great, and it carries on feeling that way for a long time, but takeoff just never happens.
7283	-1.83333333333	A gimmick in search of a movie: how to get Carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible, plot mechanics be damned.
7284	-2.66666666667	...the last time I saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my SATs.
7285	-2.83333333333	...fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty five minutes of inflated nonsense.
7286	-1.66666666667	...lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar.
7287	-1.05555555556	It's often faintly amusing, but the problems of the characters never become important to us, and the story never takes hold.
7288	-1.22222222222	It's tough, astringent, darkly funny and... well, it's also generic, untidy, condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning.
7289	-0.555555555556	Largely a for fans artifact.
7290	-2.0	There's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions, nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan, but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense, lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity.
7291	-0.75	Characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better.
7292	-0.85	There's plenty of style in Guillermo Del Toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes.
7293	-0.85	(I)f you've been to more than one indie flick in your life, chances are you've already seen this kind of thing.
7294	-1.35	First time director João Pedro Rodrigues' unwillingness to define his hero's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on.
7295	-2.0	No reason for anyone to invest their hard earned bucks into a movie which obviously didn't invest much into itself either.
7296	-0.5	A strong first quarter, slightly less so second quarter, and average second half.
7297	-2.25	A boring, wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater.
7298	-1.45	The vampire thriller Blade II starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun – toward the end, you can feel your veins cringing from the workout.
7299	-0.75	When the first few villians are introduced as ''Spider'' and ''Snake'' you know you're in for a real winner, creativity at its peak.
7300	-1.0	An Afterschool Special without the courage of its convictions.
7301	-0.3	The final result makes for adequate entertainment, I suppose, but anyone who has seen Chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal.
7302	-0.7	(Director) Byler may yet have a great movie in him, but Charlotte Sometimes is only half of one.
7303	-1.4	So few movies explore religion that it's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler.
7304	-1.0	It's also clear from the start that The Transporter is running purely on adrenaline, and once the initial high wears off, the film's shortcomings start to shine through.
7305	-1.15	Watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good.
7306	-0.25	It's fun, but a psychological mess, with Austin Powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet.
7307	-0.95	There are touching moments in Etoiles, but for the most part this is a dull, dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject.
7308	-1.35	Could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes Fatal Attraction look like a classic by comparison? That's the only sane rationale I can think of for Swimfan's existence.
7309	-1.2	I didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of Cube, and his skinny buddy Mike Epps, to make like Laurel and Hardy 'n the hood.
7310	-1.9	The only way this supernatural snore fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare.
7311	-0.8	I wonder what the reaction of Israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation.
7312	-2.3	The film would work much better as a video installation in a museum, where viewers would be free to leave. Immediately.
7313	-1.4	Human Nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy, but ultimately fails by spinning out of control.
7314	-0.95	(It's) a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy Vinnie Jones, but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy.
7315	-1.6	Not even the Hanson Brothers can save it
7316	-1.55	The thriller side of this movie is falling flat, as the stalker doesn't do much stalking, and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case.
7317	-1.45	...(a) strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for Rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense.
7318	-2.4	A sour, nasty offering.
7319	-1.2	Feels like one of those contrived, only in  Hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating Oscar talk.
7320	-1.2	Obstacles are too easily overcome and there isn't much in the way of character development in the script.
7321	0.105263157895	It tells more than it shows.
7322	-1.63157894737	Earnest falls short of its Ideal predecessor largely due to Parker's ill advised meddling with the timeless source material.
7323	-1.10526315789	The film might have been more satisfying if it had, in fact, been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles.
7324	-1.63157894737	Pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick.
7325	-2.05263157895	Not every animated film from Disney will become a classic, but forgive me if I've come to expect more from this studio than some 79 minute after school ''cartoon''.
7326	-2.26315789474	Do not, under any circumstances, consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor.
7327	-2.63157894737	Nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas, and Showtime is crammed full of them.
7328	-1.94736842105	Much anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie.
7329	-1.05263157895	This is really just another genre picture.
7330	-1.31578947368	Each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature, but in its current incarnation, Storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception.
7331	-0.210526315789	William Shatner, as a pompous professor, is the sole bright spot...
7332	-1.42105263158	A trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing    which is not to be confused with suspecting    until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home.
7333	-2.0	Neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well drawn.
7334	-0.842105263158	Acting, particularly by Tambor, almost makes ''Never Again'' worthwhile, but (writer/director) Schaeffer should follow his titular advice
7335	-0.631578947368	Both stars manage to be funny, but, like the recent I Spy, the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie.
7336	-1.0	''Collateral Damage'' goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment – until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
7337	-2.52631578947	'Enigma' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable. A waste of good performances.
7338	-3.47368421053	A dreary, incoherent, self indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours...a cacophony of pretentious, meaningless prattle.
7339	-2.26315789474	I kept thinking over and over again, 'I should be enjoying this.' But I wasn't.
7340	-1.63157894737	As conceived by Mr. Schaeffer, Christopher and Grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell.
7341	-1.94736842105	Like so many other allegedly scary movies, it gets so tangled up in The Twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten.
7342	-1.52631578947	The essential problem in Orange County is that, having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast, the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do.
7343	-1.94736842105	Just like Hearst's enormous yacht, it's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination.
7344	-3.0	There is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility, not an event that is believable, not a confrontation that is not staged, not a moment that is not false.
7345	-1.52631578947	Where last time jokes flowed out of Cho's life story, which provided an engrossing dramatic through line, here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines.
7346	-2.89473684211	Why come up with something even quasi original, when you can pillage from Shirley Jackson, Richard Matheson ... and puke up something like ROSE RED?
7347	-0.105263157895	A broadly played, lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags.
7348	-1.63157894737	... too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film.
7349	-2.52631578947	Lacks heart, depth and, most of all, purpose.
7350	0.421052631579	Though a bit of a patchwork in script and production, a glossy, rich green, environment almost makes the picture work.
7351	0.3125	perfectly enjoyable, instantly forgettable, nothing to write home about.
7352	0.0625	Wasabi is slight fare indeed, with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly (like one of Hubert's punches), but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn.
7353	-0.1875	Somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional.
7354	-1.6875	This ill fitting Tuxedo is strictly off the rack.
7355	-2.6875	The premise is in extremely bad taste, and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought out and substance free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them.
7356	-1.9375	Sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies, but fails loudly in execution.
7357	-1.625	Kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in Birthday Girl, a film by the stage trained Jez Butterworth (Mojo) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of British comedies in the post Full Monty world.
7358	-1.0625	Imagine the James Woods character from Videodrome making a home movie of Audrey Rose and showing it to the kid from The Sixth Sense and you've imagined The Ring.
7359	-2.125	This time Kaufman's imagination has failed him.
7360	-0.0625	An intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort.
7361	-1.375	It becomes gimmicky instead of compelling. ''Interview'' loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a TV episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into.
7362	-2.0	'Unfaithful' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory. Too bad.
7363	-1.25	Frenetic but not really funny.
7364	-1.0625	Taken individually or collectively, the stories never add up to as much as they promise.
7365	-2.4375	If you're not a prepubescent girl, you'll be laughing at Britney Spears' movie starring debut whenever it doesn't have you impatiently squinting at your watch.
7366	-2.125	A didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy.
7367	-2.0625	Sluggishly directed by episodic TV veteran Joe Zwick, it's a sitcom without the snap crackle.
7368	-3.0625	You could nap for an hour and not miss a thing.
7369	-1.1875	Director Clare Kilner's debut is never as daft as it should have been.
7370	-2.625	New Best Friend shouldn't have gone straight to video; it should have gone straight to a Mystery Science Theater 3000 video.
7371	-1.875	Wallace seems less like he's been burning to tell a war story than he's been itching to somehow tack one together
7372	-2.4375	The thrill is (long) gone.
7373	-2.625	Began life as a computer game, then morphed into a movie    a bad one, of course.
7374	-1.5625	Part comedy, part drama, the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full, and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas, but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole.
7375	-3.4375	Godawful boring slug of a movie.
7376	-2.5625	Dull, if not devoid of wit, this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history, but scarcely manages more than a modest, snoozy charm.
7377	-1.875	Scene by scene, things happen, but you'd be hard pressed to say what or why.
7378	-3.4375	... an unimaginative, nasty, glibly cynical piece of work.
7379	-1.3125	It is, by conventional standards, a fairly terrible movie ... but it is also weirdly fascinating, a ready made Eurotrash cult object. It is also, at times, curiously moving.
7380	-2.0	The tug of war at the core of Beijing Bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances, overheated pathos and long, wistful gazes.
7381	-3.2	Vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe Ghost Ship.
7382	-2.6	Some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations.
7383	-2.6	Being author Wells' great grandson, you'd think filmmaker Simon Wells would have more reverence for the material. But this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film.
7384	-3.35	Offensive in the way it exploits the hot button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy, treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented.
7385	-2.55	Mark me down as a non believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor.
7386	-2.9	Thoughtless, random, superficial humour and a lot of very bad Scouse accents
7387	-2.1	Aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness.
7388	-1.5	Accuracy and realism are terrific, but if your film becomes boring, and your dialogue isn't smart, then you need to use more poetic license.
7389	-1.6	For all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative, the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale.
7390	-3.15	A soggy, cliche bound epic horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title.
7391	-2.55	One groan inducing familiarity begets another.
7392	-2.0	Although based on a real life person, John, in the movie, is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours.
7393	-1.15	Great story, bad idea for a movie.
7394	-1.75	With Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams writer/director/producer Robert Rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry.
7395	-2.4	There is no entry portal in The Rules of Attraction, and I spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow, selfish, greedy characters.
7396	-2.0	It's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins.
7397	-2.25	''My god, I'm behaving like an idiot!'' Yes, you are, Ben Kingsley.
7398	-3.2	A dreadful live action movie.
7399	-2.55	Divertingly ridiculous, headbangingly noisy.
7400	-1.0	An earnest racial issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era    say, the '60s.
7401	-3.3	A hideous, confusing spectacle, one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future Rice adaptations.
7402	-2.6	All I can say is fuhgeddaboutit.
7403	-2.15	Between bedroom scenes, viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap.
7404	-2.8	If you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue, they still wouldn't add up to the time required to boil a four  minute egg.
7405	-2.25	Despite all the talking, by the time the bloody climax arrives we still don't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another.
7406	-2.75	Every bit as bogus as most Disney live action family movies are    no real plot, no real conflict, no real point.
7407	-1.2	A sensual performance from Abbass buoys the flimsy story, but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we're left wondering about this exotic looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at.
7408	-3.25	Never engaging, utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful.
7409	-1.85	Spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society, but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama.
7410	-2.9	Oedekerk wrote Patch Adams, for which he should not be forgiven. Why he was given free reign over this project    he wrote, directed, starred and produced    is beyond me.
7411	-0.625	The creaking, rusty ship makes a fine backdrop, but the ghosts' haunting is routine.
7412	0.8125	Whatever Eyre's failings as a dramatist, he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place.
7413	-1.1875	Scotland, PA. blurs the line between black comedy and black hole.
7414	-1.3125	It tries too hard, and overreaches the logic of its own world.
7415	-2.375	The whole damn thing is ripe for the Jerry Springer crowd. It's all pretty cynical and condescending, too.
7416	-2.375	I cry for I Spy    or I would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage TV spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind.
7417	-2.5	A boring, formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash.
7418	-1.5625	What you would end up with if you took Orwell, Bradbury, Kafka, George Lucas and the Wachowski Brothers and threw them into a blender. But that's just the problem with it   the director hasn't added enough of his own ingredients.
7419	-1.125	With recent tensions rekindled by the Kathleen Soliah trial and the upcoming trial of SLA members Emily and William Harris, not to mention Sept. 11, its difficult these days to appreciate Fire's bright side.
7420	-1.6875	Flaunts its quirky excesses like a New Year's Eve drunk sporting a paper party hat.
7421	-2.5625	Writhing under dialogue like 'You're from two different worlds' and 'Tonight the maid is a lie and this, this is who you are,' this schlock filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability.
7422	-2.625	...too slow, too boring, and occasionally annoying.
7423	-1.375	Is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of Wilco's last album?
7424	-0.625	Faultlessly professional but finally slight.
7425	-3.0625	Schmaltzy and unfunny, Adam Sandler's cartoon about Hanukkah is numbingly bad, Little Nicky bad, 10 Worst List bad.
7426	-2.25	It's really yet another anemic and formulaic Lethal Weapon derived buddy cop movie, trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness.
7427	-1.625	Scotland, Pa. is a strangely drab romp. Some studio pizazz might have helped.
7428	-0.0625	When Perry fists a bull at the Moore Farm, it's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart.
7429	-1.0625	There's more scatological action in 8 Crazy Nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career.
7430	-1.9375	Too loud, too long and too frantic by half, Die Another Day suggests that the Bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 cannot fly over, tunnel under or barrel through.
7431	-1.5625	The cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the Festival of Lights as Mr. Deeds was to that of Frank Capra.
7432	-1.625	...the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity.
7433	-1.0	The tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy.
7434	-2.0625	If we don't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose, we deserve the trash that we get.
7435	-1.5	A modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers.
7436	-2.0625	Julia is played with exasperating blandness by Laura Regan.
7437	-0.5625	Morrissette's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit    but it doesn't signify a whole lot either.
7438	-2.8125	There's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting...this film packs a wallop of the latter.
7439	-0.875	All Ms. Jovovich, as the sanctified heroine, has to do is look radiant, grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors, wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters.
7440	-2.0625	Mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty. Mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness.
7441	-2.05	This is a particularly toxic little bonbon, palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few.
7442	-2.4	This isn't just the CliffsNotes version of Nicholas Nickleby, it's the CliffsNotes with pages missing.
7443	-1.7	Considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts, this must have been a difficult shoot, but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well.
7444	-2.65	Better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine.
7445	-2.55	So clichéd that, at one point, they literally upset an apple cart.
7446	-0.75	It's a decent glimpse into a time period, and an outcast, that is no longer accessible, but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor.
7447	-1.35	It might be the first sci fi comedy that could benefit from a Three's Company style laugh track.
7448	-1.85	When the plot kicks in, the film loses credibility.
7449	-1.85	Credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment.
7450	-0.55	The movie takes itself too seriously and, as a result, it makes for only intermittent fun.
7451	-0.3	(Davis) has a bright, chipper style that keeps things moving, while never quite managing to connect her wish fulfilling characters to the human race.
7452	-2.1	Doesn't amount to much of anything.
7453	-2.25	Bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
7454	-3.75	So stupid, so ill conceived, so badly drawn, it created whole new levels of ugly.
7455	-2.0	The truth is that The Truth About Charlie gets increasingly tiresome.
7456	-1.5	Enduring love but exhausting cinema.
7457	-1.7	Some of Seagal's action pictures are guilty pleasures, but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto pilot.
7458	-1.5	A ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes.
7459	-1.8	A long winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been.
7460	-1.1	A little too pat for its own good.
7461	-2.55	There are films that try the patience of even the most cinema besotted critic    and this was one of them.
7462	-3.45	Watching Trouble Every Day, at least if you don't know what's coming, is like biting into what looks like a juicy, delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms.
7463	-1.75	Well intentioned though it may be, its soap opera morality tales have the antiseptic, preprogrammed feel of an after school special.
7464	-2.25	What would Jesus do if He was a film director? He'd create a movie better than this.
7465	-2.8	When a set of pre shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer, better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film, that's a bad sign. A very bad sign.
7466	-1.2	It's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject, but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history, or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story.
7467	-1.1	Can't kick about the assembled talent and the Russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers. Still, this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral.
7468	-0.8	Diane Lane shines in Unfaithful. Almost everything else is wan.
7469	-2.45	I'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by the numbers B flick with just a suspension of disbelief. Rather, you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform soaked handkerchief.
7470	-1.55	So relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something.
7471	-0.1875	The title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere.
7472	-2.5	The makers of Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood should offer a free ticket (second prize, of course, two free tickets) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie.
7473	-2.4375	God help the poor woman if Attal is this insecure in real life: his fictional Yvan's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse.
7474	-3.0625	Let's cut to the consumer advice bottom line: Stay home.
7475	-1.875	Undercover Brother doesn't go far enough. It's just a silly black genre spoof.
7476	-1.375	The film's implicit premise is that the faith of the Tonga people is in every way inferior to that of John.
7477	-1.9375	Rates an 'E' for effort    and a 'B' for boring.
7478	-2.625	You've already seen Heartbreak if you've watched the far superior Nurse Betty or Sunset Boulevard. Even the unwatchable Soapdish is more original.
7479	-1.75	Plays like one of those conversations that Comic Book Guy on ''The Simpsons'' has.
7480	-1.0	A journey that's too random and inconclusive to be compelling, but which Hoffman's brilliance almost makes worth taking.
7481	-1.3125	The movie bounces all over the map.
7482	-1.1875	But buying into sham truths and routine ''indie'' filmmaking, Freundlich has made just another safe movie. It's not horrible, just horribly mediocre.
7483	-1.5	Not always too whimsical for its own good (but enough to do harm), this strange hybrid of crime thriller, quirky character study, third rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs.
7484	-3.1875	''Juwanna Mann?'' No thanks. Wewannour money back, actually.
7485	-1.1875	It's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original.
7486	-1.3125	You're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous.
7487	-1.75	Feel bad for King, who's honestly trying, and Schwartzman, who's shot himself in the foot.
7488	-2.9375	Some actors steal scenes. Tom Green just gives them a bad odor. This self infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy Stealing Harvard, but he's the most obvious one.
7489	-1.6875	Sometimes, fond memories should stay in the past: a lesson this film teaches all too well.
7490	-1.6875	The enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized.
7491	-1.4375	Begins as a promising meditation on one of America's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt.
7492	-1.375	A monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it.
7493	-2.0	Proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot, expertly cast, paced with crisp professionalism... and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report.
7494	-2.8125	The reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then, out of embarrassment or stupidity, not warning anyone.
7495	-2.0	There's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in Point Pleasant.
7496	-1.25	In the second half of the film, Frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives Nachtwey for self analysis.
7497	-1.8125	Director Barry Skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of ''The Longest Yard'' playbook like a checklist.
7498	-1.9375	The furious coherence that (DeNiro) brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself, which feels, as it plods toward the end, less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing.
7499	-3.75	Oh, it's extreme, all right. Extremely dumb. Extremely confusing. Extremely boring.
7500	-1.8125	We never really feel involved with the story, as all of its ideas remain just that: abstract ideas.
7501	-1.85714285714	For a shoot 'em up, Ballistic is oddly lifeless.
7502	-1.61904761905	One minute, you think you're watching a serious actioner; the next, it's as though clips from The Pink Panther Strikes Again and/or Sailor Moon have been spliced in.
7503	-2.61904761905	What happened with Pluto Nash? How did it ever get made?
7504	0.619047619048	We may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again.
7505	-1.28571428571	Opens as promising as any war/adventure film you'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama, better suited for a movie titled ''Glory: A Soldier's Story.''
7506	-1.28571428571	The result is solemn and horrifying, yet strangely detached.
7507	-1.7619047619	These spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds, but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining.
7508	-1.95238095238	A long slog for anyone but the most committed Pokemon fan.
7509	-2.2380952381	Matthew McConaughey tries, and fails, to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over the top lunacy.
7510	-3.2380952381	How on earth, or anywhere else, did director Ron Underwood manage to blow $100 million on this?
7511	-2.09523809524	Everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique, which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones.
7512	-1.52380952381	With a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of Los Angeles, where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble, The Dogwalker has a few characters and ideas, but it never manages to put them on the same path.
7513	-2.42857142857	Its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent Dumas botch jobs, The Man in the Iron Mask and The Musketeer.
7514	-1.47619047619	A benign but forgettable sci fi diversion.
7515	-2.38095238095	The plot grinds on with yawn provoking dullness.
7516	-3.2380952381	It's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma. It's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition.
7517	-2.38095238095	It doesn't help that the director and cinematographer Stephen Kazmierski shoot on grungy video, giving the whole thing a dirty, tasteless feel.
7518	-2.80952380952	Desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats.
7519	-2.33333333333	This film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what Christmas tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow: a poor    if durable    imitation.
7520	-2.52380952381	John McTiernan's botched remake may be subtler than Norman Jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate sports saga. It's also stupider.
7521	-1.71428571429	Director Dirk Shafer and co writer Greg Hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama.
7522	-1.71428571429	Borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu.
7523	-2.2380952381	As (the characters) get more depressed, the story gets more tiresome, especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound.
7524	-1.90476190476	The acting by the over 25s lacks spark, with Csokas particularly unconnected.
7525	-2.09523809524	Though Howard demonstrates a great eye as a director, this Southern Gothic drama is sadly a tough sit, with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy handed metaphors to choke a horse    or at least slow him down to a canter.
7526	-1.90476190476	Falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that aren't funny.
7527	-1.0	The fight scenes are fun, but it grows tedious.
7528	-2.57142857143	Anyone who can count to five (the film's target market?) can see where this dumbed down concoction is going.
7529	-2.38095238095	All this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative   only dull.
7530	-1.71428571429	Demme's loose approach kills the suspense.
7531	-1.76470588235	This idea has lost its originality ... and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one joke picture.
7532	-0.764705882353	(Plays) in broad outline as pandering middle age buddy comedy.
7533	-2.64705882353	The film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime, one that brings military courtroom dramas down very, very low.
7534	-1.76470588235	Nothing more than a mediocre trifle.
7535	-2.29411764706	A turgid little history lesson, humourless and dull.
7536	-1.88235294118	Too silly to be frightening, too stolid to be funny, it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star, David Arquette.
7537	-1.47058823529	If Kaufman kept Cameron Diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape, in his latest, he'd have them mate.
7538	-1.82352941176	Trivial where it should be profound, and hyper cliched where it should be sincere.
7539	-2.17647058824	It would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun.
7540	-1.47058823529	Theology aside, why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story?
7541	-0.823529411765	All that (Powerpuff Girls) charm is present in the movie, but it's spread too thin.
7542	-0.705882352941	Sometimes smart but more often sophomoric.
7543	-1.58823529412	The ill conceived modern day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch.
7544	-1.88235294118	Collateral Damage is, despite its alleged provocation post 9/11, an antique, in the end. As are its star, its attitude and its obliviousness.
7545	-2.11764705882	Dawdles and drags when it should pop; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding.
7546	-1.52941176471	Its save the planet message clashes with its crass marketing.
7547	-1.58823529412	A great idea becomes a not great movie.
7548	-3.41176470588	...watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life. And if The Hours wins 'Best Picture' I just might.
7549	-3.35294117647	By the end, I was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious.
7550	-1.82352941176	Not a movie but a live action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse, it's almost funny.
7551	-1.82352941176	Feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention.
7552	-1.35294117647	Life is a crock    or something like it.
7553	-3.11764705882	Made by jackasses for jackasses.
7554	-1.17647058824	Despite a powerful portrayal by Binoche, it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum.
7555	-2.23529411765	The picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know how mixes with lack of give a damn.
7556	-2.82352941176	Bartleby is a one joke movie, and a bad joke at that.
7557	-1.76470588235	Given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same, we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster; this time, there isn't much.
7558	-2.11764705882	A bravura exercise in emptiness.
7559	-3.11764705882	Philip K. Dick must be turning in his grave, along with my stomach.
7560	-1.88235294118	Despite the premise of a good story ... it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles.
7561	-2.77777777778	All prints of this film should be sent to and buried on Pluto.
7562	-2.22222222222	Not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality, it fails the most basic relevancy test as well.
7563	0.888888888889	First good, then bothersome. Excellent acting and direction.
7564	-0.944444444444	This goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime busting comic vehicle    a well intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
7565	-1.38888888889	It's difficult to say whether The Tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing  I'm prepared to call it a draw.
7566	-1.83333333333	Even as lame horror flicks go, this is lame.
7567	-1.38888888889	So routine, familiar and predictable, it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated Final Draft computer program.
7568	-1.0	Sunshine State lacks the kind of dynamic that Limbo offers, and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece.
7569	-1.05555555556	Even legends like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston occasionally directed trifles... so it's no surprise to see a world class filmmaker like Zhang Yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential.
7570	-0.944444444444	A long winded, predictable scenario.
7571	-0.611111111111	Too close to Phantom Menace for comfort.
7572	-0.444444444444	Although trying to balance self referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor, the result doesn't fully satisfy either the die hard Jason fans or those who can take a good joke.
7573	-0.888888888889	Too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining.
7574	0.0555555555556	This movie is about lying, cheating, but loving the friends you betray.
7575	-0.833333333333	It smacks of purely commercial motivation, with no great love for the original.
7576	-0.888888888889	Melanie eventually slugs the Yankee. Too bad the former Murphy Brown doesn't pop Reese back.
7577	-1.88888888889	At the bottom rung of the series' entries.
7578	-1.16666666667	A real clunker. A well made, thoughtful, well acted clunker, but a clunker nonetheless.
7579	-1.61111111111	A dreary rip off of Goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for Hispanic Americans.
7580	-1.61111111111	The picture, scored by a perversely cheerful Marcus Miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination, is a monument to bad in all its florid variety.
7581	-1.05555555556	Good for a few unintentional laughs, ''Extreme Ops'' was obviously made for the ''XXX'' crowd, people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting, writing, and direction.
7582	-1.11111111111	...a big, baggy, sprawling carnival of a movie, stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason.
7583	-1.5	A frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy handed sentimentality.
7584	-0.611111111111	Lawrence preaches strictly to the converted.
7585	-1.0	As written by Michael Berg and Michael J. Wilson from a story by Wilson, this relentless, all wise guys all the time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all.
7586	-0.666666666667	Will probably stay in the shadow of its two older, more accessible Qatsi siblings.
7587	-1.05555555556	Just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety, it dives into soapy bathos.
7588	-0.722222222222	Choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand up comedy.
7589	-1.22222222222	...the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex, outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs.
7590	-0.444444444444	The only thing in Pauline and Paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field sized Oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers.
7591	-2.19047619048	If you're looking for comedy to be served up, better look elsewhere.
7592	-0.761904761905	It virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre, with funny bits surfacing every once in a while.
7593	-3.71428571429	An instant candidate for worst movie of the year.
7594	-2.52380952381	Despite its title, Amy's Orgasm is not a porno, though it is as tedious as one.
7595	-2.57142857143	Like a tone deaf singer at a benefit concert, John Q. is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause.
7596	-2.66666666667	Adam Sandler is to Gary Cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse.
7597	-1.95238095238	What kids will discover is a new collectible. What parents will suspect is that they're watching a 76 minute commercial.
7598	-1.42857142857	Beers, who, when she's given the right lines, can charm the paint off the wall ... (but) the script goes wrong at several key junctures.
7599	-2.90476190476	Without September 11, Collateral Damage would have been just another bad movie. Now it's a bad, embarrassing movie.
7600	-2.66666666667	Drags along in a dazed and enervated, drenched in the  past numbness.
7601	-1.66666666667	There's a disturbing 'Great White Hope' undertone to The Other Side of Heaven that subtly undermines its message of Christian love and compassion.
7602	-2.38095238095	Unless you are in dire need of a Diesel fix, there is no real reason to see it. Wait for video    and then don't rent it.
7603	-0.619047619048	The attempt is courageous, even if the result is wildly uneven.
7604	-1.90476190476	There's something fundamental missing from this story: something or someone to care about.
7605	-1.42857142857	Too much of this well acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger, more complicated story, one that never materializes.
7606	-2.90476190476	When a film is created SOLELY because it's a marketable product, soulless and ugly movies like this are the result. Let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested.
7607	-1.90476190476	Unfortunately, Heartbreak Hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit.
7608	-2.09523809524	The more Kevin Costner rests on his pretty boy laurels, the public is, regrettably, going to have tepid films like Dragonfly tossed at them.
7609	-1.2380952381	(It's) difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of American Chai, despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view.
7610	0.0	The latest installment in the Pokemon canon, Pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two, likely because much of the Japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where Pokemon graze in peace.
7611	-2.09523809524	Taken purely as an exercise in style, this oppressively gloomy techno horror clambake is impossible to ignore. But as a movie, it's a humorless, disjointed mess.
7612	-1.09523809524	If Myers decides to make another Austin Powers movie, maybe he should just stick with Austin and Dr Evil.
7613	-2.57142857143	The backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense.
7614	-3.28571428571	Too stupid to be satire, too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise, Frank Novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul killing as its title is nearly meaningless.
7615	-2.33333333333	Overly stylized with lots of flash black &amp; white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo hip luxury car commercial, (it's) at its worst when it's actually inside the ring.
7616	-1.47619047619	What is captured during the conceptual process doesn't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work, The Selection, became in its final form.
7617	-1.85714285714	If this is satire, it's the smug and self congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook.
7618	-1.19047619048	Had the film boasted a clearer, more memorable, the creepiness would have gotten under the skin.
7619	-2.66666666667	These people wouldn't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance.
7620	-2.19047619048	Imagine if you will a Tony Hawk skating video interspliced with footage from Behind Enemy Lines and set to Jersey shore techno.
7621	0.444444444444	It doesn't quite work, but there's enough here to make us look forward to the Russos' next offering.
7622	-1.05555555556	Any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment.
7623	-2.05555555556	The director's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship (most notably wretched sound design).
7624	-2.0	About as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through.
7625	-2.05555555556	Apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths. Marisa Tomei is good, but Just A Kiss is just a mess.
7626	-2.16666666667	Opens at a funeral, ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between.
7627	-2.61111111111	The noble tradition of men in drag hits an all time low in Sorority Boys, whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting, writing or direction.
7628	-2.61111111111	To portray modern women the way director Davis has done is just unthinkable.
7629	-1.44444444444	Too simple for its own good.
7630	-2.22222222222	Flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey.
7631	-2.0	A chaotic panorama that's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags.
7632	-2.11111111111	Suffers from rambling, repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video.
7633	-2.55555555556	The screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture. All the characters are stereotypes, and their interaction is numbingly predictable.
7634	-3.27777777778	A trashy, exploitative, thoroughly unpleasant experience.
7635	-1.94444444444	Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept – a high tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman.
7636	-2.5	Shouldn't have been allowed to use the word ''new'' in its title, because there's not an original character, siuation or joke in the entire movie.
7637	-0.666666666667	Often silly – and gross – but it's rarely as moronic as some campus gross out films.
7638	-1.72222222222	The advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap. Any rock pile will do for a set. Reign of Fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap.
7639	-2.66666666667	The performances are so leaden, Michael Rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud.
7640	-0.944444444444	A subtle variation on I Spit On Your Grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men.
7641	-1.66666666667	Reggio's trippy, ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified Nike ad.
7642	-1.83333333333	As Tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool, you yearn for a few airborne TV sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up.
7643	-2.38888888889	If somebody was bored and ... decided to make a dull, pretentious version of Jesus' Son, they'd come up with something like Bart Freundlich's World Traveler.
7644	-2.11111111111	The best you can say about it is it's so uninspired, it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now.
7645	-0.611111111111	A tough go, but Leigh's depth and rigor, and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness, offsets to a notable degree the film's often mined and despairing milieu.
7646	-1.83333333333	An overstuffed compendium of teen Catholic movie dogma.
7647	-1.22222222222	Too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good, it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing.
7648	-2.38888888889	Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan, Tom Clancy's intrepid hero? Ridiculous. What's next? D.J. Qualls as Indiana Jones? Or Tom Green as Han Solo?
7649	-1.88888888889	The movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension.
7650	-2.55555555556	The film is directed by Wally Wolodarsky from a script by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge. These are names to remember, in order to avoid them in the future.
7651	-2.7	If this is the resurrection of the Halloween franchise, it would have been better off dead.
7652	-1.35	This formulaic chiller will do little to boost Stallone's career.
7653	-1.95	I saw Knockaround Guys yesterday, and already the details have faded like photographs from the Spanish American War ... It's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink.
7654	-1.65	Though Avary has done his best to make something out of Ellis' nothing novel, in the end, his Rules is barely worth following.
7655	-1.55	The average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small town America.
7656	-0.4	No worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer, and slightly better than Men in Black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go.
7657	-1.6	The plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before Sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset.
7658	-1.55	At first, the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious, but as the film goes on, the joke wears thin.
7659	-1.5	Never Again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and, along the way, expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds.
7660	-2.35	the story itself is uninteresting, and the songs are painfully undistinguished: They Might Be Giants' So to Be One of Us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed.
7661	-2.2	Technically, the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial.
7662	-2.6	The title's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is.
7663	-0.35	The parts are better than the whole (bizarre, funny, tragic   like love in New York).
7664	-0.6	While the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an American movie might demand, Scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a Hollywood production.
7665	-1.35	The humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch, elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny.
7666	-2.65	It's a movie forged in the fires of Chick Flick Hell.
7667	-2.15	Its characters are thinner than cardboard    or even comic book paper.
7668	-2.4	Any one episode of The Sopranos would send this ill conceived folly to sleep with the fishes.
7669	-1.5	Feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the Lifetime cable television network.
7670	-1.6	Lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life, because she's driven by ambition and Doesn't Know How to Have Fun.
7671	-0.1	Credit must be given to Harland Williams, Michael Rosenbaum and Barry Watson, who inject far more good natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
7672	-1.5	Denzel Washington's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony.
7673	-2.7	If this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift, somebody unwrapped it early, took out all the good stuff, and left behind the crap (literally).
7674	-1.55	So faithful to the doldrums of the not quite urban, not quite suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check.
7675	-2.1	Rambles on in a disjointed, substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next.
7676	-0.9	There's an audience for it, but it could have been funnier and more innocent.
7677	-2.05	I can only imagine one thing worse than Kevin Spacey trying on an Irish accent, and that's sultry Linda Fiorentino doing the same thing.
7678	-2.6	An awkward and indigestible movie.
7679	-1.65	The movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs.
7680	-1.2	Haneke keeps us at arm's length. Guided more by intellect than heart, his story flattens instead of sharpens.
7681	-2.41666666667	All the well meaningness in the world can't erase the fact that The Believer feels like a 12 Step Program for the Jewish Nazi.
7682	-1.5	Like most sequels, it takes what worked last time, repeats it and adds more characters, more stunts, more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness.
7683	-2.29166666667	There's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong. This is an hour and a half of daydreaming.
7684	-1.91666666667	Message movie or an action packed submarine spectacular? Alas, it's neither.
7685	-2.08333333333	No movement, no yuks, not much of anything.
7686	-3.08333333333	'Dragonfly' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck.
7687	-1.95833333333	Thirty years ago, it would have been groundbreaking. Now it's just tired.
7688	-1.75	Heavy handed exercise in time vaulting literary pretension.
7689	-1.25	The movie is too cute to take itself too seriously, but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students.
7690	-1.66666666667	A thinly veiled excuse for Wilson to play his self deprecating act against Murphy's well honed prima donna shtick.
7691	-1.95833333333	A minor picture with a major identity crisis    it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho hum all the way through.
7692	-1.95833333333	The movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark.
7693	-1.625	Plays as hollow catharsis, with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights.
7694	-2.41666666667	It will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary. But here's the real damn: It isn't funny, either.
7695	-1.25	Quick: who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security?
7696	-1.33333333333	The reason I found myself finally unmoved by this film, which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say, is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory.
7697	-1.70833333333	What you get with Empire is a movie you've seen many times before, repackaged as new material because there is a Latino in the lead.
7698	-1.04166666667	Cho's fans are sure to be entertained; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that    on the basis of this film alone    I'm not one of them.
7699	-2.0	Looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a Mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination.
7700	-1.79166666667	The period    swinging London in the time of the mods and the rockers    gets the once over once again in Gangster No. 1, but falls apart long before the end.
7701	-2.25	High Crimes miscasts nearly every leading character.
7702	-1.79166666667	The overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy, but there's still a real sense that the Star Trek tradition has been honored as best it can, given the embarrassing script and weak direction.
7703	-2.5	De Niro looks bored, Murphy recycles Murphy, and you mentally add Showtime to the pile of Hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal.
7704	-2.16666666667	I didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot.
7705	-1.54166666667	Another rent installment for the Ian Fleming estate.
7706	-0.833333333333	With Danilo Donati's witty designs and Dante Spinotti's luscious cinematography, this might have made a decent children's movie    if only Benigni hadn't insisted on casting himself in the title role.
7707	-2.25	So lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft core imagery with naughty fun.
7708	-0.625	Though it draws several decent laughs, it's low cal Woody at best.
7709	-1.54166666667	Has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags.
7710	-0.833333333333	Britney's performance cannot be faulted. Lucy's a dull girl, that's all.
7711	-1.11111111111	Well shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons.
7712	-1.61111111111	Sadly, Hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low cut gowns, not making snappy comebacks.
7713	-2.38888888889	If Melville is creatively a great whale, this film is canned tuna.
7714	-1.66666666667	This film is so slick, superficial and trend hoppy, that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay.
7715	-2.61111111111	Just one more collection of penis, breast and flatulence gags in search of a story. Or a profit. Or some damn thing.
7716	-3.05555555556	The acting is stiff, the story lacks all trace of wit, the sets look like they were borrowed from Gilligan's Island    and the CGI Scooby might well be the worst special effects creation of the year.
7717	-2.38888888889	Enough trivializes an important crisis, reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment.
7718	-1.66666666667	The makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and, instead, rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep. I like Frank the Pug, though.
7719	-0.944444444444	A restrained Ribisi convinces as an Italian, though if ever a movie needed one of the actor's whiny jags to pump it up, this has to be among the rare ones.
7720	-1.22222222222	Gee, a second assassin shot Kennedy? Moot point.
7721	-1.88888888889	A hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face.
7722	-2.0	Needless to say, the dramatics that follow are utter hooey.
7723	-1.55555555556	The problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise, Mr. Desplechin is content to state it.
7724	-2.33333333333	Madonna still can't act a lick.
7725	-2.0	Even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of Todd Farmer's screenplay, which is a simple retread of the 1979 Alien, with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship.
7726	-1.27777777778	If you pitch your expectations at an all time low, you could do worse than this oddly cheerful    but not particularly funny    body switching farce.
7727	-1.0	The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life. But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored.
7728	-0.388888888889	Serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and, perhaps unwittingly, relating it to what is happening in America in 2002. But hard to believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour.
7729	-1.33333333333	Don't let your festive spirit go this far.
7730	-1.5	Though the book runs only about 300 pages, it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like Mr. Schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear.
7731	-0.833333333333	Hey, at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading.
7732	-2.88888888889	Intended to be a comedy about relationships, this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area.
7733	-0.833333333333	Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary.
7734	-1.72222222222	Director Brian Levant, who never strays far from his sitcom roots, skates blithely from one implausible situation to another, pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a French poodle.
7735	-2.83333333333	...perhaps the heaviest, most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world.
7736	-1.77777777778	Suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle, but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal.
7737	-2.5	I'd give real money to see the perpetrators of Chicago torn apart by dingoes.
7738	-1.61111111111	Movies like this are selling the old European candor, the old wink of 'bold' revelation. But in 2002, such revelations wilt.
7739	-1.5	The timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off.
7740	-1.0	I admire it and yet cannot recommend it, because it overstays its natural running time.
7741	0.25	A fairly by the books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy.
7742	-1.45	Flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind.
7743	1.6	Even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before, it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to Belushi's easy going likableness.
7744	-1.85	The story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence.
7745	0.2	Despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy.
7746	-1.95	McKay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean spiritedness
7747	-2.9	A recipe for cinematic disaster...part Quentin Tarantino, part Guy Ritchie, and part 1960s spy spoof, it's all bad.
7748	-1.6	The cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama.
7749	-2.7	Another big, dumb action movie in the vein of XXX, The Transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black BMW through.
7750	-2.3	Aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with Townsend. When she speaks, her creepy Egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music.
7751	-1.4	Outrageousness is all Plympton seemed to be going for this time. We miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride.
7752	-1.95	Much of what is meant to be 'inspirational' and 'uplifting' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing (the movie's) mindset.
7753	-1.7	Well before it's over, Beijing Bicycle begins spinning its wheels.
7754	-1.25	Home Alone goes Hollywood, a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even Steven Spielberg would know how to do. Besides, real movie producers aren't this nice.
7755	-1.7	(Nelson's) movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised, unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes.
7756	-1.85	Passion, lip synching, tragedy, and lots of really really high notes. For me, this opera isn't a favorite, so it's a long time before the fat lady sings.
7757	-2.75	Looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due.
7758	-1.65	Truth to tell, if you've seen more than half a dozen horror films, there's nothing here you haven't seen before.
7759	-2.05	Abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists.
7760	-2.2	Even die hard fans of Japanese animation ... will find this one a challenge.
7761	-3.3	Filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low. Fortunately for all involved, this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water.
7762	-1.75	The movie gets muted and routine.
7763	-1.1	The issue of faith is not explored very deeply
7764	-2.3	It's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over, but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest.
7765	-2.1	The situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels.
7766	-2.2	It's frustrating to see these guys    who are obviously pretty clever    waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high.
7767	-1.9	I was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness.
7768	-2.25	K 19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic, but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy Saving Private Ryanovich.
7769	-0.95	A very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale...a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more.
7770	-1.85	Automatically pegs itself for the straight to video sci fi rental shelf.
7771	-1.62962962963	The film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off.
7772	-1.96296296296	Feels less like it's about teenagers, than it was written by teenagers.
7773	-1.48148148148	Ja Rule and Kurupt should have gotten to rap. It would have benefitted the dialogue.
7774	-0.740740740741	A standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas.
7775	-2.66666666667	Elicits more groans from the audience than Jar Jar Binks, Scrappy Doo and Scooby Dumb, all wrapped up into one.
7776	-3.2962962963	It's badly acted, blandly directed, and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school.
7777	-1.92592592593	In the end, White Oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel. It's a flashy, star splashed reduction.
7778	-2.66666666667	This film, starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock, is your typical 'fish out of water' story. You've seen them a million times. Just one problem: Fish out of water usually die. This one does.
7779	-1.96296296296	The angst ridden, affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging.
7780	-2.85185185185	A soggy, shapeless mess...just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted house movie.
7781	-2.2962962963	Men in Black II has sequel itis something fierce. An ungainly, comedy deficient, B movie rush job...
7782	-2.03703703704	A combination of standard, stiff TV style animation and snazzy looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move.
7783	-1.92592592593	An unsatisfying hybrid of Blair Witch and typical stalk and slash fare, where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living.
7784	-2.18518518519	Say this for the soundtrack, it drowns out the lousy dialogue.
7785	-2.11111111111	After seeing SWEPT AWAY, I feel sorry for Madonna.
7786	-1.66666666667	Instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing, Hart's War, like the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl, waits until after halftime to get started.
7787	-2.85185185185	A gob of drivel so sickly sweet, even the eager consumers of Moore's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée.
7788	-2.25925925926	Maudlin and melodramatic we expected. Boring we didn't.
7789	-1.62962962963	Never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline doesn't live up to Barry's dead eyed, perfectly chilled delivery.
7790	-1.44444444444	The film's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place.
7791	-0.703703703704	It almost plays like Solaris, but with guns and jokes.
7792	-2.81481481481	A baffling misfire, and possibly the weakest movie (Woody Allen) has made in the last twenty years.
7793	-1.74074074074	It won't be long before you'll spy I Spy at a video store near you.
7794	-2.48148148148	This film looks like it was produced in 1954, shelved for 48 years, and repackaged for a 2002 audience.
7795	-1.81481481481	Propelled not by characters but by caricatures.
7796	-2.66666666667	There is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production.
7797	-3.07407407407	This extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes, but feels twice as long.
7798	-1.81481481481	Earnest but earthbound...a slow, soggy, soporific, visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast.
7799	-2.14814814815	The pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky.
7800	-1.44444444444	For all its alleged youthful fire, XXX is no less subservient to Bond's tired formula of guns, girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero.
7801	-1.29411764706	A predictable and stereotypical little B movie.
7802	-2.35294117647	If I Spy were funny (enough) or exciting (enough) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public.
7803	-1.76470588235	Frustratingly, Dridi tells us nothing about El Gallo other than what emerges through his music.
7804	-1.94117647059	Places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult to swallow setting, and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller.
7805	-1.76470588235	Stephen Earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition – wearing a cloak of unsentimental, straightforward text – when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type.
7806	-0.705882352941	A very average science fiction film.
7807	-2.23529411765	Undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay, the glacier paced direction and the stereotypical characters.
7808	-3.11764705882	How anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us.
7809	-3.23529411765	The sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap.
7810	-2.47058823529	The cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself, which contains few laughs and not much drama.
7811	-2.23529411765	The plot is straight off the shelf, the performances are television  caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy.
7812	-1.82352941176	ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer thin on dramatic substance
7813	-1.29411764706	A whimsical if predictable time travel fable marred by a willful single mindedness.
7814	-2.64705882353	Those who managed to avoid the Deconstructionist theorizing of French philosopher Jacques Derrida in college can now take an 85 minute brush up course with the documentary Derrida. Or, you can do something fun tonight.
7815	-2.23529411765	Jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips.
7816	-1.41176470588	As with too many studio pics, plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter than air adventure.
7817	-3.52941176471	Static, repetitive, muddy and blurry, Hey Arnold! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year.
7818	-2.23529411765	For all of the contemporary post colonialist consciousness that Kapur tries to bring to The Four Feathers, the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear.
7819	-2.29411764706	When it comes to entertainment, children deserve better than Pokemon 4Ever.
7820	-2.23529411765	What The Four Feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about.
7821	-2.17647058824	While Benigni (who stars and co wrote) seems to be having a wonderful time, he might be alone in that.
7822	-1.76470588235	Yes, 4Ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes, but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to Spirited Away?
7823	-2.17647058824	Preposterous and tedious, Sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that, unfortunately, occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure.
7824	-3.52941176471	Calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment: it's more like entertainment for trolls.
7825	-2.76470588235	None of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life, unless you happen to know annoyingly self involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter.
7826	-2.88235294118	... just a big mess of a movie, full of images and events, but no tension or surprise.
7827	-2.05882352941	As elegantly crafted as it often is, Anderson's movie is essentially a one trick pony that, hampered by an undeveloped script, ultimately pulls up lame.
7828	-2.70588235294	Splashes its drama all over the screen, subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured, but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings.
7829	-2.64705882353	... has virtually no script at all ...
7830	-2.70588235294	Will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good, the bad and the ugly.
7831	-1.35294117647	This kind of dark comedy requires a delicate, surgical touch. But director Danny DeVito and screenwriter Adam Resnick (remember Cabin Boy?) just pound away.
7832	-1.11764705882	At times, however, Dogtown and Z Boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow, or care about.
7833	0.235294117647	Rather quickly, the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation.
7834	-1.82352941176	Screenwriters Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni have turned Rice's complex Akasha into a cartoon monster.
7835	-1.47058823529	The writers, director Wally Wolodarsky, and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity: Kappa Rho Alpha Phi.
7836	-3.64705882353	Bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description.
7837	-2.05882352941	The new faces are interesting, but the old story isn't, especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted.
7838	-1.94117647059	Most of the action setups are incoherent.
7839	-1.82352941176	Liman, of Swingers and Go, makes his big budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long, low heat chase, interrupted by a middling car chase.
7840	-1.35294117647	... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs.
7841	-1.58823529412	The problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake down the throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball.
7842	-3.05882352941	Dreary, highly annoying...'Some Body' will appeal to No One.
7843	-1.76470588235	There's something deeply creepy about Never Again, a new arrow in Schaeffer's quiver of ineptitudes.
7844	-2.64705882353	The problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one, there's no saving the movie. Sorry, Charlie
7845	-2.52941176471	A painfully leaden film destined for pre dawn cable television slots.
7846	-2.64705882353	Blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be, but Ahola is simply not an actor. And in truth, cruel as it may sound, he makes Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Spencer Tracy.
7847	-2.76470588235	The cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon TV is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters.
7848	-2.58823529412	Shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self absorption.
7849	-1.82352941176	This pep talk for faith, hope and charity does little to offend, but if saccharine earnestness were a crime, the film's producers would be in the clink for life.
7850	-1.17647058824	All ends well, sort of, but the frenzied comic moments never click.
7851	-2.11764705882	If this is the Danish idea of a good time, prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination    some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war, perhaps.
7852	-2.35294117647	Formula 51 is so trite that even Yu's high energy action stylings can't break through the stupor.
7853	-1.0	Only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives, still with the boiler suit and white mask, which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry.
7854	-2.58823529412	When the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters, you know you're in trouble.
7855	-1.88235294118	(Two) fairly dull    contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable Scandinavian settlers in 18th century Canada, and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now.
7856	-1.35294117647	The film is really not so much bad as bland.
7857	-1.29411764706	The central story lacks punch.
7858	-1.58823529412	Though Ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way, there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention.
7859	-3.05882352941	This may be the dumbest, sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer's coming of age.
7860	-2.0	Succumbs to the same kind of maudlin, sentimental mysticism that mars the Touched by an Angel school of non God spiritual uplift movies.
7861	1.11111111111	A harmless and mildly amusing family comedy.
7862	-1.38888888889	What was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical.
7863	-2.05555555556	The kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion.
7864	-1.16666666667	''Men in Black II,'' has all the earmarks of a sequel. The story is less vibrant, the jokes are a little lukewarm, but will anyone really care?
7865	-2.22222222222	Sucking all the 'classic' out of Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island and filling the void with sci fi video game graphics and Disney fied adolescent angst...
7866	-0.166666666667	This 72 minute film does have some exciting scenes, but it's a tad slow.
7867	-0.444444444444	While Super Troopers is above Academy standards, its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling.
7868	-2.33333333333	A mix of velocity and idiocy, this ruinous remake lacks the brawn    and the brains    of the 1970s original.
7869	-2.38888888889	The low budget Full Frontal was one of the year's murkiest, intentionally obscure and self indulgent pictures, and Solaris is its big budget brother.
7870	-1.44444444444	The plot is very clever, but Boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events, all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of.
7871	-0.444444444444	The film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future Quentin Tarantino picture
7872	-2.44444444444	A free for all of half baked thoughts, clumsily used visual tricks and self indulgent actor moments.
7873	-3.27777777778	Apallingly absurd...the chemistry or lack thereof between Newton and Wahlberg could turn an Imax theater into a 9" black and white portable TV.
7874	-0.277777777778	A well acted and well intentioned snoozer.
7875	-3.05555555556	The smug, oily demeanor that Donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named Pipe Dream is just repulsive.
7876	-0.0555555555556	Must see viewing for anyone involved in the high tech industry. Others may find it migraine inducing, despite Moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding.
7877	-0.833333333333	Despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments, Super Troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development.
7878	-0.777777777778	It's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature length video game with some really heavy back story.
7879	-2.72222222222	I watched the brainless insanity of No Such Thing with mounting disbelief.
7880	-2.0	This limp gender bender baller from a first time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's Tootsie, forgetting only to retain a single laugh.
7881	-0.555555555556	Kwan makes the mix and  match metaphors intriguing, while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action.
7882	-1.38888888889	While obviously an extremely personal work, it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut.
7883	-3.11111111111	Any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes. Like a marathon runner trying to finish a race, you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it.
7884	-0.222222222222	I loved looking at this movie. I just didn't care as much for the story.
7885	-0.888888888889	Has all the poignancy of a Hallmark card and all the comedy of a Gallagher stand up act.
7886	-0.666666666667	It doesn't do the original any particular dishonor, but neither does it exude any charm or personality.
7887	-2.38888888889	fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense.
7888	-1.16666666667	A gorgeous, somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising.
7889	-2.77777777778	A semi autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of Bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it.
7890	-1.94444444444	It feels like a community theater production of a great Broadway play: Even at its best, it will never hold a candle to the original.
7891	-0.866666666667	The film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice over instead of speaking to each other.
7892	-1.0	The element of surprise might be the only thing Femme Fatale has going for it.
7893	-0.6	It's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch, yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it.
7894	-0.8	Maybe it's asking too much, but if a movie is truly going to inspire me, I want a little more than this.
7895	-1.93333333333	A graceless, witless attempt at mating Some Like It Hot with the WWII espionage thriller.
7896	-1.06666666667	The story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough.
7897	-0.4	Based on a David Leavitt story, the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness, too facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness.
7898	-0.8	Just like every other Seagal movie, only louder and without that silly ponytail.
7899	-0.333333333333	To enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by Jolie and Burns, you have to gloss over the no sense ending.
7900	-2.66666666667	National Lampoon's Van Wilder could be the worst thing to come out of National Lampoon since Class Reunion
7901	-1.4	This is a great subject for a movie, but Hollywood has squandered the opportunity, using it as a prop for warmed over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director John Woo has built his career on.
7902	-1.93333333333	Ecks this one off your must see list.
7903	-1.33333333333	Overall, the film misses the brilliance of Jelinek's novel by some way. It settles for being merely grim.
7904	-2.6	The Irwins emerge unscathed, but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted.
7905	-2.26666666667	It's not thirsty, consuming passion which drives this movie. No, it's the repetition of said behavior, and so Children of the Century is more mindless love than mad, more grating and boring than anything else.
7906	-1.86666666667	Just because it really happened to you, honey, doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else.
7907	-2.0	Just like the deli sandwich: lots of ham, lots of cheese, with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after (or during) consumption of its second half.
7908	-2.0	Every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it. The New Guy is one of them.
7909	-1.66666666667	This isn't a ''Friday'' worth waiting for.
7910	-1.2	Everything that's worthwhile about Collision Course can already be seen on television.
7911	-1.8	If this movie belonged to a sorority, it would be called Beta Alpha Delta.
7912	-0.0666666666667	Not a cheap slasher flick, as the subject matter would suggest, but is a little like a nature film, showing a patient predator and his foolish prey.
7913	-1.4	Uneasy mishmash of styles and genres.
7914	-1.0	Herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable, but the notion that a strong, unified showing among Germany and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th Century history is undermined by Ahola's inadequate performance.
7915	-1.4	All in all, there's only one thing to root for: expulsion for everyone.
7916	-1.26666666667	Beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines ... there just isn't much to laugh at.
7917	-0.6	Secret Ballot is too contemplative to be really funny.
7918	-1.66666666667	The film's center will not hold.
7919	-2.13333333333	Myers never knows when to let a gag die; thus, we're subjected to one mind numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another.
7920	-1.53333333333	Too lazy to take advantage of its semi humorous premise.
7921	-2.66666666667	A great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie, and Crazy as Hell doesn't even have a great ending.
7922	-2.06666666667	Dialogue heavy and too cerebral for its own good    or, at any rate, too cerebral for its racy subject matter.
7923	-1.66666666667	Its over reliance on genre conventions, character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops.
7924	-1.26666666667	As an actor, The Rock is aptly named.
7925	-2.06666666667	A mostly tired retread of several other mob tales.
7926	-2.33333333333	I wish I could say ''Thank God It's Friday'', but the truth of the matter is I was glad when it was over.
7927	-2.06666666667	Nothing about it fits.
7928	-1.8	As it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends, it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them.
7929	-2.0	Somehow we're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids, travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world, don fatigues and become G.I. Jane.
7930	-2.2	The cast is so low wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct.
7931	-2.4	Consider the title's clunk on the head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept.
7932	-2.26666666667	The movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable. I tried to read the time on my watch.
7933	-2.0	The film makes a tragic error by going on for too long, trying to mirror every subsequent event in Chinese history: war, revolution, Communism, etc.
7934	-2.0	Johnson has, in his first film, set himself a task he is not nearly up to.
7935	-2.6	Ultimately the project comes across as clinical, detached, uninvolving, possibly prompting audience members to wonder, 'What's the point?'
7936	-1.53333333333	The two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot, but so much naturalistic small talk, delivered in almost muffled exchanges, eventually has a lulling effect.
7937	-1.4	The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom, but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing.
7938	-2.66666666667	The movie is as far as you can get from racy, to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain; it has a dull, costumey feel.
7939	-2.06666666667	Once the audience figure out what's being said, the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care.
7940	-2.33333333333	There's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought.
7941	-2.2	It seems just a long, convoluted ploy to get men into drag    period drag, no less.
7942	-2.33333333333	The premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six packs and a pitcher of margaritas in, but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover.
7943	-2.93333333333	Even by dumb action movie standards, Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever is a dumb action movie.
7944	-1.93333333333	The film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes.
7945	-2.86666666667	Just a bloody mess.
7946	-1.73333333333	Creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller.
7947	-1.8	You would be better off investing in the worthy EMI recording that serves as the soundtrack, or the home video of the 1992 Malfitano Domingo production.
7948	-1.73333333333	Has something to say... but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller.
7949	-2.53333333333	Bears is bad. Not 'terrible filmmaking' bad, but more like, 'I once had a nightmare like this, and it's now coming true' bad.
7950	-1.6	As is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions, the film is less poetic than simply pretentious.
7951	-2.31578947368	George, hire a real director and good writers for the next installment, please.
7952	-1.89473684211	For a film about two mismatched buddies, Crystal and De Niro share little screen time and even less chemistry.
7953	-1.31578947368	However clever Nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging, the question remains whether this should, indeed, have been presented as a theatrical release.
7954	-3.21052631579	Extreme Oops   oops, ops, no matter how you spell it, it's still a mistake to go see it.
7955	-2.68421052632	What could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent.
7956	-3.31578947368	What will, most likely, turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002.
7957	-2.52631578947	...too dull to enjoy.
7958	-1.94736842105	A morality tale whose thought provoking potential is hampered by a made for TV look, rigid performances and an asinine 'twist' that brazenly rips off The Sixth Sense.
7959	-1.15789473684	Here's a self congratulatory 3D IMAX rah rah.
7960	-0.578947368421	Eastwood is an icon of moviemaking, one of the best actors, directors and producers around, responsible for some excellent work. But even a hero can stumble sometimes.
7961	-1.78947368421	A sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago    or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about.
7962	-1.0	It's all very cute, though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old.
7963	-1.36842105263	The impact of the Armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day.
7964	-0.526315789474	Going to the website may be just as fun (and scary) as going to the film.
7965	-2.42105263158	Lacking gravitas, MacDowell is a placeholder for grief, and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel. Leave these Flowers unpicked    they're dead on the vine.
7966	-0.947368421053	Admirable, certainly, but not much fun to watch. For Caine Lovers only.
7967	-3.10526315789	A shambles of a movie  visually unattractive, unbearably loud and utterly silly...its hilarity is completely unintentional.
7968	-2.78947368421	De Niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to Clint Eastwood in the lazy Bloodwork. But like Bruce Springsteen's gone to pot Asbury Park, New Jersey, this sad sack waste of a movie is a City of ruins.
7969	-2.15789473684	No, it's not nearly as good as any of its influences.
7970	-1.31578947368	A reasonably efficient mechanism, but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided.
7971	-1.21052631579	The rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is, although it's more comedy than suspense De Palma creates.
7972	-1.36842105263	Human Nature talks the talk, but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal.
7973	-0.894736842105	City by the Sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving: It's careful, conscientious and makes no major mistakes. But what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing.
7974	-2.0	The Marquis de Sade couldn't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be.
7975	-1.57894736842	What could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy handed melodrama.
7976	0.368421052632	The cast is uniformly excellent ... but the film itself is merely mildly charming.
7977	-1.42105263158	Drives for the same kind of bittersweet, conciliatory tone that Three Seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality.
7978	-2.73684210526	A bigger holiday downer than your end of year 401(k) statement.
7979	-2.31578947368	The whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit.
7980	-2.42105263158	Fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters. And forget about any attempt at a plot!
7981	-0.444444444444	It will probably prove interesting to Ram Dass fans, but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow, peace and love side of the '60s counterculture.
7982	-1.55555555556	Take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are John Leguizamo's cool jackets.
7983	-2.88888888889	It's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief    and worry about what classic Oliver Parker intends to mangle next time.
7984	-2.0	Showtime is closer to Slowtime.
7985	-1.83333333333	It may be an easy swipe to take, but this Barbershop just doesn't make the cut.
7986	-2.0	The Weight of Water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire, but this leaky script barely stays afloat.
7987	-1.66666666667	'How many more voyages can this limping but dearly loved franchise survive?'
7988	-1.77777777778	Despite a blue chip cast and a provocative title, writer director Peter Mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux contemporary gravy.
7989	-1.94444444444	Fans of the TV series will be disappointed, and everyone else will be slightly bored.
7990	-2.27777777778	The only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll.
7991	-1.44444444444	Barely goes beyond comic book status.
7992	-2.0	It's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big name actors and cameos at a hokey script.
7993	-3.05555555556	I Spy is an embarrassment, a monotonous, disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations. It's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun.
7994	-0.111111111111	An eccentric little comic/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality.
7995	-1.61111111111	Afraid to pitch into farce, yet only half hearted in its spy mechanics, All the Queen's Men is finally just one long drag.
7996	-0.944444444444	Maybe it's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages, but something aboul ''Full Frontal'' seems, well, contrived.
7997	-1.55555555556	(Morgan), Judd and Franklin can't save the script, rooted in a novel by Joseph Finder, from some opportunism.
7998	-1.33333333333	Passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless.
7999	-0.944444444444	Safe Conduct, however ambitious and well intentioned, fails to hit the entertainment bull's eye.
8000	-0.777777777778	My response to the film is best described as lukewarm. Maybe I found the proceedings a little bit too conventional.
8001	-1.16666666667	Too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century.
8002	-1.77777777778	It's push the limits teen comedy, the type written by people who can't come up with legitimate funny, and it's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed.
8003	-1.66666666667	It's too long, too repetitive, and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner.
8004	-0.777777777778	A sudsy cautionary tale.
8005	-2.11111111111	A movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a Bolly Holly masala mess.
8006	-1.22222222222	Mr. Wedge and Mr. Saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well. Their film falters, however, in its adherence to the Disney philosophy of required poignancy, a salute that I'd hoped the movie would avoid.
8007	-1.55555555556	Leaves you with a knot in your stomach, its power is undercut by its own head banging obviousness.
8008	-2.22222222222	Watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives. As your relatives swap one mundane story after another, you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart.
8009	-2.0	Unfortunately, as a writer, Mr. Montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor.
8010	-0.833333333333	On the right track to something that's creepy and effective ... It's just going to take more than a man in a Bullwinkle costume to get there.
8011	-2.11111111111	The only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy, jovial team.
8012	-2.16666666667	One of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly, but feeling pandered to, which, in the end, might be all the more infuriating.
8013	-1.77777777778	...this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core.
8014	-2.33333333333	Murder By Numbers is like a couple of mediocre TV movie  of the week films clumsily stuck together.
8015	0.333333333333	The film is surprisingly well directed by Brett Ratner, who keeps things moving well    at least until the problematic third act.
8016	-1.66666666667	Warmed over Tarantino by way of wannabe Elmore Leonard.
8017	-1.16666666667	(Sen's) soap opera ish approach undermines his good intentions.
8018	-2.16666666667	Showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant ''if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns, the movie will be funny'' syndrome.
8019	0.722222222222	Sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre.
8020	-2.83333333333	Don't waste your money.
8021	-1.72222222222	Though certainly original in form, Altar Boys requires a taste for Swamp Thing type animation, doubled with a deafening score.
8022	-0.444444444444	There aren't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of Georgian Jews in Tel Aviv.
8023	-1.66666666667	There's not enough to sustain the comedy.
8024	-1.55555555556	Like those to Rome, all roads in The Banger Sisters inevitably lead to a joke about Hawn's breasts, which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them.
8025	-1.16666666667	We may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the Balkans conflict.
8026	-2.11111111111	You're better off staying home and watching The X Files.
8027	-3.16666666667	Chaotic, self indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at, it's...like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature length horror.
8028	-1.94444444444	Bears resemblance to, and shares the weaknesses of, too many recent action fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences.
8029	-2.05555555556	This is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another.
8030	-1.94444444444	Friday After Next has the same problem that Next Friday did    it's called Where's Chris Tucker When You Need Him?
8031	-1.83333333333	This film is full of rabbits. Brimful. But like most rabbits, it seems to lack substance.
8032	-2.72222222222	I weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider Blue Crush to be an intelligent film about young women.
8033	-2.11111111111	I kept wishing I was watching a documentary about the wartime Navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious Hollywood hoo ha.
8034	-2.44444444444	No number of fantastic sets, extras, costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story.
8035	-2.44444444444	A movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious Charlie Kaufman might object to.
8036	-2.72222222222	Could The Country Bears really be as bad as its trailers? In a word    yes.
8037	-2.72222222222	If High Crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title.
8038	-2.55555555556	Reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns, creating a meandering, inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film.
8039	-3.27777777778	The movie makes absolutely no sense. Its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question: Since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb?
8040	-2.61111111111	The problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot. Had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent, we all could have stopped watching long ago.
8041	-2.31818181818	Despite the authenticity of the trappings, the film is overblown in its plotting, hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style.
8042	-2.0	Murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous.
8043	-1.5	The journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full blown movie.
8044	-1.0	That Zhang would make such a strainingly cute film    with a blind orphan at its center, no less    indicates where his ambitions have wandered.
8045	-0.681818181818	The Gantzes' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook.
8046	-1.77272727273	The streets, shot by cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, may be as authentic as they are mean, but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them.
8047	-1.27272727273	This is a good movie in spurts, but when it doesn't work, it's at important times.
8048	-1.63636363636	Parker probably thinks he's shaking up a classic the way Kenneth Branagh and Baz Luhrmann have, but this half hearted messing about just makes us miss Wilde's still contemporary play.
8049	-1.90909090909	Flotsam in the sea of moviemaking, not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising.
8050	-1.86363636364	A TV episode inflated past its natural length.
8051	-1.31818181818	Involving at times, but lapses quite casually into the absurd.
8052	-2.09090909091	All these developments and challenges facing Santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility.
8053	-1.59090909091	There are weird resonances between actor and role here, and they're not exactly flattering.
8054	-2.31818181818	The unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive, the director just ends up exposing his own obsession.
8055	-2.40909090909	The story ... is moldy and obvious.
8056	-2.5	It's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational, and yet it's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff.
8057	-2.13636363636	Suffocated at conception by its Munchausen by proxy mum. Punish the vehicle to adore the star.
8058	-2.5	Even if Britney Spears is really cute, her movie is really bad.
8059	-2.0	Big Fat Liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities.
8060	-1.86363636364	Usually when I get this much syrup, I like pancakes to go with it.
8061	-1.40909090909	All the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure.
8062	-2.13636363636	Glib, satirical documentary that fudges facts, makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism.
8063	-2.72727272727	Gangs of New York is an unapologetic mess, whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up.
8064	-2.72727272727	An overblown clunker full of bad jokes, howling cliches and by the numbers action sequences.
8065	-2.22727272727	Without a strong script and energetic acting, Dogma films can produce the same sleep inducing effects as watching your neighbor's home videos.
8066	-1.59090909091	A mild, reluctant, thumbs down.
8067	-1.86363636364	Strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and B film thuggery.
8068	-1.68181818182	Schindler's List it ain't.
8069	-2.63636363636	A cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency.
8070	-2.22727272727	It's an awfully derivative story.
8071	-2.38888888889	The movie barely makes sense, with its unbelievable naïveté and arbitrary flashbacks.
8072	-1.11111111111	It's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances, but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable.
8073	-2.66666666667	About as cutting edge as Pet Rock: The Movie.
8074	-2.44444444444	With generic sets and B grade special effects, Jason is about as convincing on the sci fi front as TV's defunct Cleopatra 2525.
8075	-2.11111111111	Not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip hop sorely disappointed.
8076	-1.5	Winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults.
8077	-1.61111111111	Oft described as the antidote to American Pie type sex comedies, it actually has a bundle in common with them, as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough
8078	-2.27777777778	The pacing is glacial, the screenplay is stiff as a board, and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes.
8079	-1.94444444444	The premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the Clericks as this becomes just another kung fu sci fi movie with silly action sequences.
8080	-2.94444444444	With its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere, The Ring makes its stupidity more than obvious. It's painful.
8081	-1.94444444444	Pumpkin struts about with ''courage'' pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back.
8082	-1.94444444444	An uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously.
8083	-1.16666666667	Sheridan ... smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth.
8084	-2.66666666667	An atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding.
8085	-2.0	Half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo sophisticated cultural observations, while the remainder...would be more at home on a daytime television serial.
8086	-2.0	Writer/director John McKay ignites some charming chemistry between Kate and Jed but, when he veers into sodden melodrama, punctuated by violins, it's disastrous and Kate's jealous female friends become downright despicable.
8087	-1.88888888889	(Newton)wanders through CHARLIE completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality.
8088	-2.22222222222	Unfortunately, the picture failed to capture me. I found it slow, drab, and bordering on melodramatic.
8089	-3.27777777778	A lousy movie that's not merely unwatchable, but also unlistenable.
8090	-2.94444444444	The best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations. Then lower them a bit more.
8091	-2.72222222222	When not obscured by the booming bass heavy soundtrack, the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since Macy Gray's game of Chinese whispers with Mr Bean.
8092	-2.11111111111	Cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke.
8093	-2.88888888889	A woozy, roisterous, exhausting mess, and the off beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill starred as you might expect.
8094	-3.16666666667	'Abandon all hope, ye who enter here'...you should definitely let Dante's gloomy words be your guide.
8095	-2.22222222222	What begins as a seemingly brainless, bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche drenched melodrama by mid film and, by film's end, a feminist action fantasy.
8096	-2.16666666667	A grim, flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level.
8097	-1.33333333333	Birot's directorial debut (she co wrote the script with Christophe Honoré) isn't so much bad as it is bland.
8098	-1.61111111111	Watching the film is like reading a Times Portrait of Grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it.
8099	-3.0	Enough similarities to Gymkata and Howie Long's Firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long suffering eyeballs.
8100	-2.22222222222	Succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long dreaded completion of the Police Academy series.
8101	0.238095238095	Christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their Lord as a luv spreading Dr. Feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists, who might even praise God for delivering such an instant camp classic.
8102	-2.57142857143	If this dud had been made in the '70s, it would have been called The Hills Have Antlers and played for about three weeks in drive ins.
8103	-1.7619047619	A frantic search for laughs, with a hit to miss ratio that doesn't exactly favour the audience.
8104	-0.904761904762	Like a documentary version of Fight Club, shorn of social insight, intellectual pretension and cinematic interest.
8105	-1.33333333333	''An entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters.''
8106	-2.33333333333	Pryor Lite, with half the demons, half the daring, much less talent, many fewer laughs.
8107	-1.95238095238	What's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete, if irritating, notion of class.
8108	-1.33333333333	The stories here suffer from the chosen format.
8109	-1.28571428571	While the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest, the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization, humor or plain old popcorn fun.
8110	-1.42857142857	Just how extreme are these ops? I regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough.
8111	-1.52380952381	The actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus.
8112	-1.28571428571	John Leguizamo may be a dramatic actor    just not in this movie.
8113	-2.95238095238	The sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense.
8114	-1.7619047619	Hardly makes the kind of points Egoyan wanted to make, nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build, to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world.
8115	-3.38095238095	Build some robots, haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show, and put on your own Mystery Science Theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst    and only    killer website movie of this or any other year.
8116	-1.09523809524	Rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down.
8117	-1.85714285714	...has about 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor    but it's a rushed, slapdash, sequel for the sake  of a sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity.
8118	-2.80952380952	The Master Of Disaster   it's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy.
8119	-0.952380952381	The film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie friendly... Alas, Santa is more ho hum than ho ho ho and the Snowman (who never gets to play that flute) has all the charm of a meltdown.
8120	-3.71428571429	The stupidest, most insulting movie of 2002's first quarter.
8121	-2.09523809524	It's so underwritten that you can't figure out just where the other characters, including Ana's father and grandfather, come down on the issue of Ana's future.
8122	-2.95238095238	A film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not.
8123	-1.57142857143	None of this violates the letter of Behan's book, but missing is its spirit, its ribald, full throated humor.
8124	-2.47619047619	Bad Company leaves a bad taste, not only because of its bad luck timing, but also the staleness of its script.
8125	-0.285714285714	Even if it ultimately disappoints, the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat.
8126	-1.33333333333	Fails to bring as much to the table.
8127	-2.47619047619	A film made with as little wit, interest, and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy Hollywood caper flick.
8128	-2.04761904762	Disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material.
8129	-1.47619047619	If you're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick flick slog.
8130	-3.61904761905	I hate this movie
8131	-2.66666666667	It's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie, directed by Scott Kalvert, about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 Brooklyn    stale cliches, gratuitous violence, or empty machismo.
8132	-2.38888888889	Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners, a fact which, as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through Snow Dogs, seems inconceivable.
8133	-2.5	At every opportunity to do something clever, the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability... all you have left is a no surprise series of explosions and violence while Banderas looks like he's not trying to laugh at how bad it
8134	-3.55555555556	...pitiful, slapdash disaster. A DOA dud from frame one.
8135	-2.5	Jaw droppingly superficial, straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as John Ritter's glory days on Three's Company.
8136	-1.22222222222	There are plenty of scenes in Frida that do work, but rarely do they involve the title character herself.
8137	-0.888888888889	Although God Is Great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film.
8138	-1.44444444444	The dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film. First timer John McKay is never able to pull it back on course.
8139	-1.72222222222	Distances you by throwing out so many red herrings, so many false scares, that the genuine ones barely register.
8140	-1.44444444444	Godard uses his characters    if that's not too glorified a term    as art things, mouthpieces, visual motifs, blanks.
8141	-2.16666666667	The movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing.
8142	-2.66666666667	A predictable, manipulative stinker. The story passes time until it's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal, fireballs and revenge.
8143	-0.333333333333	Eastwood winces, clutches his chest and gasps for breath. It's a spectacular performance   ahem, we hope it's only acting.
8144	-2.27777777778	The movie suffers from two fatal ailments    a dearth of vitality and a story that's shapeless and uninflected.
8145	-2.16666666667	It's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness, and where Human Nature should be ingratiating, it's just grating.
8146	-0.333333333333	An ambitiously naturalistic, albeit half baked, drama about an abused, inner city autistic teen.
8147	-2.0	once she lets her love depraved leads meet, (Denis') story becomes a hopeless, unsatisfying muddle
8148	-1.44444444444	The dose is strong and funny, for the first 15 minutes anyway; after that, the potency wanes dramatically.
8149	-1.61111111111	The people in ABC Africa are treated as docile, mostly wordless ethnographic extras.
8150	-2.66666666667	What's really sad is to see two Academy Award winning actresses (and one Academy Award winning actor) succumb to appearing in this junk that's TV sitcom material at best.
8151	-1.83333333333	No doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place. Where their heads were is anyone's guess.
8152	-1.55555555556	Call me a cynic, but there's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life affirming message.
8153	-3.22222222222	A gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero dimensional, unlikable characters and hackneyed, threadbare comic setups.
8154	-0.777777777778	Got some good, organic character work, lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging, imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2 hour, dissipated length.
8155	-2.83333333333	A painfully slow cliche ridden film filled with more holes than Clyde Barrow's car.
8156	-1.88888888889	Like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions.
8157	-1.88888888889	I guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood, nothing good can happen.
8158	-1.77777777778	Gaghan captures the half lit, sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms, a subtlety that makes the silly, over the top coda especially disappointing.
8159	-1.61111111111	Feels less like a change in (Herzog's) personal policy than a half hearted fluke.
8160	-3.61111111111	One of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced.
8161	-0.8	Will anyone who isn't a Fangoria subscriber be excited that it hasn't gone straight to video?
8162	-1.0	A selection of scenes in search of a movie.
8163	-1.4	(Janey) forgets about her other obligations, leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes, maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies.
8164	-0.8	Will undoubtedly play well in European markets, where Mr. Besson is a brand name, and in Asia, where Ms. Shu is an institution, but American audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic.
8165	-2.4	True to its animatronic roots:...as stiff, ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus...'The Country Bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation.
8166	-0.866666666667	(Evans is) a fascinating character, and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie.
8167	-1.46666666667	The script's judgment and sense of weight is way, way off.
8168	-1.13333333333	You come away wishing, though, that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story.
8169	-1.86666666667	Evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story, but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention.
8170	-1.6	A derivative collection of horror and sci fi cliches.
8171	-1.6	Loosely speaking, we're in All of Me territory again, and, strictly speaking, Schneider is no Steve Martin.
8172	-2.0	As aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice, the movie makes two hours feel like four.
8173	-2.0	Limps along on a squirm inducing fish out of water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very, very slowly.
8174	-2.06666666667	Just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name.
8175	-2.06666666667	The redeeming feature of Chan's films has always been the action, but the stunts in The Tuxedo seem tired and, what's worse, routine.
8176	-0.666666666667	While The Importance of Being Earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles, it doesn't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond Wilde's wit and the actors' performances.
8177	-2.33333333333	Has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool.
8178	-1.4	A rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel.
8179	-0.4	A Lifetime movie about men.
8180	0.333333333333	The Balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman.
8181	-1.06666666667	It's hard to say who might enjoy this, are there Tolstoy groupies out there? It's dark and tragic, and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
8182	-2.2	This is a movie that starts out like Heathers, then becomes Bring it On, then becomes unwatchable.
8183	-1.2	The screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines.
8184	-1.8	I think it was Plato who said, 'I think, therefore I know better than to rush to the theatre for this one.'
8185	-1.26666666667	If Damon and Affleck attempt another Project Greenlight, next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about.
8186	-2.26666666667	This is rote drivel aimed at Mom and Dad's wallet.
8187	-2.6	Contrived, maudlin and cliche ridden...if this sappy script was the best the contest received, those rejected must have been astronomically bad.
8188	-1.26666666667	I hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of High Art.
8189	-1.6	This is more a case of 'Sacre bleu!' than 'Magnifique'.
8190	-1.46666666667	The kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored, cheering the pratfalls but little else; their parents, wise folks that they are, read books.
8191	-1.8	Whether Jason X is this bad on purpose is never clear. But one thing's for sure: It never comes close to being either funny or scary.
8192	-2.2	Yet another weepy Southern bore athon.
8193	-0.733333333333	I like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material, but they're treading water at best in this forgettable effort.
8194	-1.86666666667	Perhaps the most annoying thing about Who Is Cletis Tout? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime.
8195	-1.66666666667	Except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke, you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made.
8196	-2.26666666667	This insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering. Instead, it'll only put you to sleep.
8197	-2.0	Who is this movie for? Not kids, who don't need the lesson in repugnance. It's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers    not everyone thinks poo poo jokes are 'edgy.'
8198	-2.13333333333	A sleep inducingly slow paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue, heavy handed phoney feeling sentiment, and an overly familiar set of plot devices.
8199	-1.8	It's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake, dishonest, entertaining and, ultimately, more perceptive moment in Bridget Jones's Diary.
8200	-2.33333333333	Almost as offensive as ''Freddy Got Fingered.''
8201	-0.4	The gifted Crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself, and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him.
8202	-2.73333333333	It is depressing, ruthlessly pained and depraved, the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound.
8203	-1.93333333333	Ponderous, plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film.
8204	-2.6	Cold, pretentious, thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy.
8205	-1.2	For the future, one hopes Mr. Plympton will find room for one more member of his little band, a professional screenwriter.
8206	-3.06666666667	A cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at Revolution Studios and Imagine Entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life.
8207	-0.0666666666667	Reign of Fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise, but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness.
8208	-0.666666666667	Human Nature is a goofball movie, in the way that Malkovich was, but it tries too hard.
8209	-1.6	Originality is sorely lacking.
8210	1.06666666667	The plot's clearly mythic structure may owe more to Disney's strong sense of formula than to the original story. But while the highly predictable narrative falls short, Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold.
8211	-1.26666666667	Though there are entertaining and audacious moments, the movie's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker's flailing reputation.
8212	-0.266666666667	Ram Dass Fierce Grace moulds itself as an example to up and coming documentarians, of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour.
8213	-0.8	Lucky Break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless, but it's also drab and inert.
8214	-1.4	For a story set at sea, Ghost Ship is pretty landbound, with its leaden acting, dull exposition and telegraphed 'surprises.'
8215	-1.8	There might be some sort of credible gender provoking philosophy submerged here, but who the hell cares?
8216	-1.4	Nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing.
8217	-0.866666666667	I like my Christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho's.
8218	-1.73333333333	It all seemed wasted like DeNiro's once promising career and the once grand Long Beach boardwalk.
8219	-0.4	(I)t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot button issues in a comedic context, but Barbershop isn't as funny as it should be.
8220	-1.33333333333	Unfortunately, a cast of competent performers from movies, television and the theater are cast adrift in various New York City locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style.
8221	-0.133333333333	Just entertaining enough not to hate, too mediocre to love.
8222	-0.733333333333	'Sophisticated' viewers who refuse to admit that they don't like it will likely call it 'challenging' to their fellow sophisticates.
8223	-2.26666666667	Equilibrium the movie, as opposed to the manifesto, is really, really stupid.
8224	-3.06666666667	Excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic.
8225	-1.93333333333	The film's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes ... drag the movie down.
8226	-1.73333333333	It doesn't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is, or even its attitude toward its subject.
8227	-2.66666666667	This kiddie oriented stinker is so bad that I even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
8228	-2.0	Though Impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture, it too is a bomb.
8229	-1.4	Cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos, but there are no movies of Nijinsky, so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge.
8230	-2.4	Every note rings false.
8231	-2.4	When the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year, you'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence.
8232	-1.2	It never rises to its clever what if concept.
8233	-0.866666666667	Admirably ambitious but self indulgent.
8234	-1.2	This story of unrequited love doesn't sustain interest beyond the first half hour.
8235	-0.933333333333	This angst ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in Ordinary People.
8236	-1.66666666667	The entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another. About half of them are funny, a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story, which is paper thin and decidedly unoriginal.
8237	-2.86666666667	A big, loud, bang the drum bore.
8238	-3.06666666667	(Less a movie than) an appalling, odoriferous thing... so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you'll want to crawl up your own *** in embarrassment.
8239	-1.6	The concept behind Kung Pow: Enter the Fist is hilarious. It's too bad nothing else is.
8240	-0.933333333333	Hardman is a grating, mannered onscreen presence, which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast.
8241	-1.06666666667	El Crimen Del Padre Amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti Catholic protestors.
8242	-0.0666666666667	Interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of Carmen
8243	-1.73333333333	A serious movie with serious ideas. But seriously, folks, it doesn't work.
8244	-0.533333333333	There's nothing exactly wrong here, but there's not nearly enough that's right.
8245	-1.06666666667	The action here is unusually tame, the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest, and the plot offers few surprises.
8246	-1.6	I couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy.
8247	-1.6	What Madonna does here can't properly be called acting    more accurately, it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing, sometimes all at once.
8248	-2.2	(A) painfully flat gross out comedy ...
8249	-1.66666666667	Even if you're an Elvis person, you won't find anything to get excited about on this DVD.
8250	-0.333333333333	The movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue, but there's just not much lurking below its abstract surface.
8251	-2.3125	It's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction.
8252	-0.8125	I'm sure there's a teenage boy out there somewhere who's dying for this kind of entertainment.
8253	-2.0	The Tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life.
8254	-2.125	The film is a confusing melange of tones and styles, one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama.
8255	-2.875	Obviously, a lot of people wasted a lot of their time (including mine) on something very inconsequential.
8256	-1.4375	There's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention, but it grows monotonous after a while, as do Joan and Philip's repetitive arguments, schemes and treachery.
8257	-2.6875	It drowns in sap.
8258	-0.9375	Deliberately and devotedly constructed, Far from Heaven is too picture postcard perfect, too neat and new pin like, too obviously a recreation to resonate.
8259	-1.5	It's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious.
8260	-2.0625	I'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment. There's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease.
8261	-2.6875	The good thing    the only good thing    about Extreme Ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my Thanksgiving to do list.
8262	-1.375	The modern day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th century ones.
8263	0.0	Blessed with a searing lead performance by Ryan Gosling (Murder by Numbers), the movie is powerful and provocative. It's also built on a faulty premise, one it follows into melodrama and silliness.
8264	-2.1875	Uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth.
8265	-2.375	Director Jay Russell stomps in hobnail boots over Natalie Babbitt's gentle, endearing 1975 children's novel.
8266	-2.125	Benigni's Pinocchio is extremely straight and mind numbingly stilted, its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow.
8267	-2.125	The troubling thing about Clockstoppers is that it doesn't make any sense.
8268	-1.75	With its paint fights, motorized scooter chases and dewy eyed sentiment, it's a pretty listless collection of kid movie clichés.
8269	-1.75	Mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic: two parts exhausting Men in Black mayhem to one part family values.
8270	-2.625	Kicks off with an inauspicious premise, mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper.
8271	-1.5	A rote exercise in both animation and storytelling.
8272	-0.9375	The material and the production itself are little more than routine.
8273	-1.3125	The movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula, though, and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had.
8274	-3.125	Not even Steven Spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie.
8275	-1.3125	It's all surface psychodramatics.
8276	-2.0	The Mothman Prophecies, which is mostly a bore, seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece.
8277	-1.3125	That frenetic spectacle (on the TV show) has usually been leavened by a charm that's conspicuously missing from the Girls' big screen blowout.
8278	-2.375	Kitschy, flashy, overlong soap opera.
8279	-1.1875	For all the time we spend with these people, we never really get inside of them.
8280	-1.75	Yet another Arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents.
8281	-0.884615384615	Sandra Bullock, despite downplaying her good looks, carries a little too much ain't  she cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff.
8282	-0.769230769231	An undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic.
8283	-1.15384615385	too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize, and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay.
8284	-1.69230769231	There is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy minute running time.
8285	-0.615384615385	A wordy wisp of a comedy.
8286	-1.88461538462	Broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all, and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient.
8287	-1.76923076923	(Seagal's) strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's Razzie.
8288	-2.0	Has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung together TV episodes.
8289	-0.884615384615	A series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander, some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story.
8290	-1.76923076923	Ozpetek offers an AIDS subtext, skims over the realities of gay sex, and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all inclusive world where uptight, middle class bores like Antonia can feel good about themselves.
8291	-1.73076923077	A dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness.
8292	-3.07692307692	The Sweetest Thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance.
8293	-3.07692307692	Sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists, idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even Freeman can't save it.
8294	-1.96153846154	I realized that no matter how fantastic Reign of Fire looked, its story was making no sense at all.
8295	-1.46153846154	It made me realize that we really haven't had a good cheesy B movie playing in theaters since... well... since last week's Reign of Fire.
8296	-2.73076923077	Some movies were made for the big screen, some for the small screen, and some, like Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever, were made for the palm screen.
8297	-2.07692307692	SC2 is an autopilot Hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic Christmas spirit, yet it's geared toward an audience full of masters of both.
8298	-2.26923076923	After all the big build up, the payoff for the audience, as well as the characters, is messy, murky, unsatisfying.
8299	-2.42307692308	Seems content to dog paddle in the mediocre end of the pool, and it's a sad, sick sight.
8300	1.69230769231	It's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy; Diesel, with his brawny frame and cool, composed delivery, fits the bill perfectly.
8301	0.384615384615	If all of Eight Legged Freaks was as entertaining as the final hour, I would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation.
8302	-1.73076923077	Suffers from a flat script and a low budget.
8303	-2.0	There are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church, synagogue or temple doesn't mean you have to check your brain at the door. The same should go for movie theaters.
8304	-2.0	Seemingly a vehicle to showcase the Canadian's inane ramblings, Stealing Harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former Mr. Drew Barrymore.
8305	-1.5	The film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film.
8306	-0.230769230769	As it stands it's an opera movie for the buffs.
8307	-3.30769230769	This franchise has not spawned a single good film. The crap continues.
8308	-2.96153846154	Its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who hasn't been living under a rock (since Sept. 11).
8309	-0.153846153846	High drama, Disney style   a wing and a prayer and a hunky has been pursuing his castle in the sky.
8310	-2.92307692308	Like its script, which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire Olympic swim team through, the characters in Swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull, brain deadening hangover.
8311	-2.53333333333	One big blustery movie where nothing really happens. When it comes out on video, then it's the perfect cure for insomnia.
8312	-1.93333333333	Like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop, Comedian runs out of steam after a half hour.
8313	-1.73333333333	The pairing does sound promising in theory...but their lack of chemistry makes Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro in Showtime look like old, familiar vaudeville partners.
8314	-1.26666666667	Director Chris Eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking.
8315	-1.4	As it stands, there's some fine sex onscreen, and some tense arguing, but not a whole lot more.
8316	-1.53333333333	I could just feel the screenwriter at every moment 'Tap, tap, tap, tap, tapping away' on this screenplay.
8317	-1.93333333333	The picture doesn't know it's a comedy.
8318	-2.66666666667	A stupid, derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense.
8319	-1.46666666667	The rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey.
8320	-1.26666666667	Roman Polanski directs The Pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart; very meticulously but without any passion.
8321	-1.53333333333	Nothing more than a run of the mill action flick.
8322	-1.2	Lan Yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama, but it doesn't even try for the greatness that Happy Together shoots for (and misses).
8323	-1.6	This is an action movie with an action icon who's been all but decommissioned.
8324	-1.26666666667	Even if it is generally amusing from time to time, I Spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have.
8325	-2.53333333333	Much like Robin Williams, Death to Smoochy has already reached its expiration date.
8326	-2.73333333333	An annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere.
8327	-2.53333333333	A tired, unnecessary retread...a stale copy of a picture that wasn't all that great to begin with.
8328	-1.93333333333	An often unfunny romp.
8329	-1.73333333333	A worthy idea, but the uninspired scripts, acting and direction never rise above the level of an after school TV special.
8330	-1.13333333333	Twenty years later, Reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery, but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast forward technology that he so stringently takes to task.
8331	-2.2	Ear splitting exercise in formula crash and bash action.
8332	-0.733333333333	We have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting.
8333	-1.4	Despite Hoffman's best efforts, Wilson remains a silent, lumpish cipher; his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before.
8334	-1.2	There's a thin line between likably old fashioned and fuddy duddy, and The Count of Monte Cristo ... never quite settles on either side.
8335	-2.0	The emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down.
8336	-1.53333333333	Schaefer's...determination to inject farcical raunch...drowns out the promise of the romantic angle.
8337	-1.86666666667	Like Showgirls and Glitter, the most entertaining moments here are unintentional.
8338	-1.06666666667	While some of the camera work is interesting, the film's mid to low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work.
8339	-0.466666666667	The origin story is well told, and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books. It's in the action scenes that things fall apart.
8340	-1.46666666667	Impostor is a step down for director Gary Fleder.
8341	-1.88235294118	Seagal, who looks more like Danny Aiello these days, mumbles his way through the movie.
8342	-2.58823529412	The movie is a negligible work of manipulation, an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt trip parents.
8343	-1.88235294118	Lacks dramatic punch and depth.
8344	-1.05882352941	There are moments of real pleasure to be found in Sara Sugarman's whimsical comedy Very Annie Mary but not enough to sustain the film.
8345	-3.11764705882	I can analyze this movie in three words: Thumbs Friggin' Down.
8346	-1.82352941176	Sadly, 'Garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'Wayne.'
8347	-2.64705882353	Make like the title and dodge this one.
8348	-2.58823529412	This is not one of the movies you'd want to watch if you only had a week to live.
8349	-1.76470588235	The first hour is tedious though Ford and Neeson capably hold our interest, but its just not a thrilling movie.
8350	-1.58823529412	Here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable, and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre, implausible behavior.
8351	-2.29411764706	It's obvious (Je Gyu is) trying for poetry; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom.
8352	-1.0	Sweet Home Alabama is one dumb movie, but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end.
8353	-3.11764705882	(Green is) the comedy equivalent of Saddam Hussein, and I'm just about ready to go to the U.N. and ask permission for a preemptive strike.
8354	-2.64705882353	No amount of good acting is enough to save Oleander's uninspired story.
8355	-3.52941176471	A vile, incoherent mess...a scummy ripoff of David Cronenberg's brilliant 'Videodrome.'
8356	-1.64705882353	Murphy and Wilson actually make a pretty good team... but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote.
8357	-1.64705882353	Despite its raucous intent, XXX is as conventional as a Nike ad and as rebellious as spring break.
8358	-2.17647058824	Think The Lion King redone for horses, with fewer deliberate laughs, more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by Bryan Adams, the world's most generic rock star.
8359	-1.47058823529	It is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by Southern blacks as distilled through a Caucasian perspective.
8360	-1.35294117647	It's tough being a black man in America, especially when the Man has taken away your car, your work hours and denied you health insurance.
8361	-2.17647058824	A small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director, Tom Dey, had spliced together bits and pieces of Midnight Run and 48 Hours (and, for that matter, Shrek).
8362	-2.76470588235	An amateurish, quasi improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video.
8363	-2.35294117647	The holes in this film remain agape    holes punched through by an inconsistent, meandering, and sometimes dry plot.
8364	-2.94117647059	Would Benigni's Italian Pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster?
8365	-2.17647058824	Unofficially, National Lampoon's Van Wilder is Son of Animal House. Officially, it is twice as bestial but half as funny.
8366	-2.05882352941	This is a fragmented film, once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie.
8367	-0.941176470588	Mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer's bloated effects fest The Mummy Returns.
8368	-1.23529411765	Halfway through the movie, the humor dwindles. It's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have (and probably should have) been a lighthearted comedy.
8369	-0.882352941176	will be far more interesting to the Soderbergh faithful than it will be to the casual moviegoer who might be lured in by Julia Roberts...
8370	-0.294117647059	Authentic, and at times endearing, humorous, spooky, educational, but at other times as bland as a block of snow.
8371	-2.75	Control Alt Delete Simone as quickly as possible
8372	-2.65	Follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor, verve and fun.
8373	-1.15	The filmmaker ascends, literally, to the Olympus of the art world, but he would have done well to end this flawed, dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster.
8374	-1.35	The screenplay comes across, rather unintentionally, as Hip Hop Scooby Doo.
8375	-1.2	Has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies...
8376	-0.85	Vaguely interesting, but it's just too too much.
8377	-2.65	...no charm, no laughs, no fun, no reason to watch.
8378	-1.5	A generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under 10 set.
8379	-2.05	Kung Pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after Oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party.
8380	-1.55	Kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business.
8381	-2.55	The film virtually chokes on its own self consciousness.
8382	-1.95	A manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse.
8383	0.85	Everything in Maid in Manhattan is exceedingly pleasant, designed not to offend. It goes down easy, leaving virtually no aftertaste.
8384	-2.9	A profoundly stupid affair, populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility.
8385	-2.55	...pays tribute to heroes the way Julia Roberts hands out awards  with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism.
8386	-2.35	Time stands still in more ways that one in Clockstoppers, a sci fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable.
8387	-1.8	As a director, Eastwood is off his game    there's no real sense of suspense, and none of the plot 'surprises' are really surprising.
8388	-1.3	Eccentric enough to stave off doldrums, Caruso's self conscious debut is also eminently forgettable.
8389	-1.5	To work, love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer. That is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion.
8390	-1.95	Although Barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television, music and stand up comedy, this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless `70s blaxploitation shuck and jive sitcom.
8391	-0.3	A puzzle whose pieces do not fit. Some are fascinating and others are not, and in the end, it is almost a good movie.
8392	-1.15	Would that Greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility.
8393	-0.55	The good is very, very good... The rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful.
8394	-1.8	'Butterfingered' is the word for the big fisted direction of Jez Butterworth, who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach.
8395	-2.75	Be forewarned, if you're depressed about anything before watching this film, you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards.
8396	-3.1	a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome. In the wrong hands, i.e. Peploe's, it's simply unbearable
8397	-1.8	An inexperienced director, Mehta has much to learn.
8398	-2.2	A limp Eddie Murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of.
8399	-2.6	So muddled, repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style.
8400	-0.65	A gushy episode of ''M*A*S*H'' only this time from an Asian perspective.
8401	-1.125	''Looking For Leonard'' just seems to kinda sit in neutral, hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something.
8402	-2.04166666667	Nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly familiar and poorly constructed comedy.
8403	0.125	Definitely in the guilty pleasure B movie category, Reign of Fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable.
8404	-0.916666666667	Good looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like Clueless Does South Fork.
8405	0.333333333333	entertaining enough, but nothing new
8406	-1.29166666667	...one resurrection too many.
8407	-1.5	This is a film about the irksome, tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout. Even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life, the mood remains oddly detached.
8408	-0.708333333333	DeMeo is not without talent; he just needs better material.
8409	-2.16666666667	In spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers, apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice.
8410	-2.20833333333	No one involved, save Dash, shows the slightest aptitude for acting, and the script, credited to director Abdul Malik Abbott and Ernest 'Tron' Anderson, seems entirely improvised.
8411	-0.958333333333	Initially gripping, eventually cloying POW drama.
8412	-1.45833333333	A timid, soggy near miss.
8413	-1.25	Works better in the conception than it does in the execution...winds up seeming just a little too clever.
8414	-1.58333333333	To the vast majority of more casual filmgoers, it will probably be a talky bore.
8415	-1.5	Observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension    and sometimes plain wacky implausibility    throughout Maelstrom.
8416	-2.16666666667	This version of H.G. Wells' Time Machine was directed by H.G. Wells' great grandson. They should have found Orson Welles' great grandson.
8417	-0.958333333333	Shunji Iwai's All About Lily Chou Chou is a beautifully shot, but ultimately flawed film about growing up in Japan.
8418	-0.916666666667	With more character development this might have been an eerie thriller; with better payoffs, it could have been a thinking man's monster movie.
8419	-0.958333333333	Thriller directorial debut for Traffic scribe Gaghan has all the right parts, but the pieces don't quite fit together.
8420	-0.916666666667	...would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie's edges.
8421	-1.75	There's not a single jump in your seat moment and believe it or not, Jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects.
8422	-0.791666666667	Goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy, seductive pacing ... but she and writing partner Laurence Coriat don't manage an equally assured narrative coinage.
8423	-1.29166666667	Though Harris is affecting at times, he cannot overcome the sense that Pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities.
8424	-1.66666666667	The documentary is much too conventional    lots of boring talking heads, etc.    to do the subject matter justice.
8425	-1.75	The movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart.
8426	-1.08333333333	This is not a Jackie Chan movie. It's just a movie that happens to have Jackie Chan in it. And that makes all the difference.
8427	-1.04166666667	Far too clever by half, Howard's film is really a series of strung together moments, with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies, daydreams, memories and one fantastic visual trope after another.
8428	-2.25	The problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum. A Rumor of Angels doesn't just slip    it avalanches into forced fuzziness.
8429	-2.45833333333	No big whoop, nothing new to see, zero thrills, too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film.
8430	-2.20833333333	I don't think this movie loves women at all.
8431	-2.05882352941	Shankman ... and screenwriter Karen Janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of Bible parables and not an actual story.
8432	-1.17647058824	A negligible British comedy.
8433	-2.11764705882	Fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers.
8434	-2.58823529412	Slack and uninspired, and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you're left with a sour taste in your mouth.
8435	-3.23529411765	Skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you're sure to get more out of the latter experience.
8436	-1.47058823529	What can one say about a balding 50 year old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log?
8437	-2.58823529412	Trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the ''Gadzooks!''
8438	-1.52941176471	Her film is like a beautiful food entrée that isn't heated properly, so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless.
8439	-1.52941176471	Like the world of his film, Hartley created a monster but didn't know how to handle it.
8440	-1.23529411765	No new plot conceptions or environmental changes, just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through.
8441	-1.05882352941	Needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point of view shots and fewer slow motion 'grandeur' shots and quick cut edits that often detract from the athleticism.
8442	-1.29411764706	In the end, there isn't much to it.
8443	-1.76470588235	A waste of fearless purity in the acting craft.
8444	-1.64705882353	The film is ultimately about as inspiring as a Hallmark card.
8445	-1.29411764706	Anyone not into high tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally, and log on to something more user friendly.
8446	-1.64705882353	Disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances.
8447	-1.94117647059	You could easily mistake it for a sketchy work in progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time.
8448	-1.17647058824	Directors Harry Gantz and Joe Gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter, but the couples exposing themselves aren't all that interesting.
8449	-1.47058823529	Yet another entry in the sentimental oh those wacky Brits genre that was ushered in by The Full Monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit.
8450	-1.94117647059	for those for whom the name Woody Allen was once a guarantee of something fresh, sometimes funny, and usually genuinely worthwhile, Hollywood Ending is a depressing experience
8451	-1.70588235294	Femme Fatale offers nothing more than a bait and switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience. Are we dealing with dreams, visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of Clue?
8452	-1.52941176471	It could have been something special, but two things drag it down to mediocrity    director Clare Peploe's misunderstanding of Marivaux's rhythms, and Mira Sorvino's limitations as a classical actress.
8453	-1.41176470588	Fluffy neo noir hiding behind cutesy film references.
8454	-1.0	Imagine Susan Sontag falling in love with Howard Stern.
8455	-1.70588235294	Like being trapped inside a huge video game, where exciting, inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again.
8456	-1.88235294118	Should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor.
8457	1.23529411765	The best thing about the movie is its personable, amusing cast.
8458	-1.29411764706	These guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they're simply not funny performers.
8459	-2.05882352941	Everything was as superficial as the forced New Jersey lowbrow accent Uma had.
8460	-1.47058823529	Director David Fincher and writer David Koepp can't sustain it.
8461	-1.4	Finally coming down off of Miramax's deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts, Waking Up in Reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie.
8462	-1.2	A movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen targeted action TV series.
8463	-2.6	One of the most highly praised disappointments I've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time.
8464	-0.533333333333	The animation and backdrops are lush and inventive, yet Return to Neverland never manages to take us to that elusive, lovely place where we suspend our disbelief.
8465	-0.933333333333	Director Shekhar Kapur and screenwriters Michael Schiffer and Hossein Amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things, but the barriers finally prove to be too great.
8466	-1.4	Strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose, and in that oh so important category, The Four Feathers comes up short.
8467	-2.86666666667	The thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes (of which they'll get plenty) fills me with revulsion.
8468	-2.46666666667	Devolves into the derivative, leaning on badly rendered CGI effects.
8469	-2.2	Anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in 'The Ring.'
8470	-2.86666666667	A grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy French grandfather.
8471	-3.13333333333	The script is a disaster, with cloying messages and irksome characters.
8472	-2.0	both overstuffed and undernourished... The film can't be called a solid success, although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate Clooney might have better luck next time.
8473	-1.73333333333	Plods along, minus the twisted humor and eye popping visuals that have made Miike ... a cult hero.
8474	-2.33333333333	Hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from Alfred Hitchcock's imaginative flight to Shyamalan's self important summer fluff.
8475	-2.2	The film's maudlin focus on the young woman's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of Hollywood heart string plucking.
8476	-1.66666666667	I firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon. I also believe that Resident Evil is not it.
8477	-2.0	It has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark, a pop influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition.
8478	-1.13333333333	The plot meanders from gripping to plodding and back.
8479	-2.8	This is cruel, misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy.
8480	-2.73333333333	No amount of nostalgia for Carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that Carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it.
8481	-0.866666666667	Best described as I Know What You Did Last Winter.
8482	-1.4	(Taylor) takes us on a ride that's consistently surprising, easy to watch    but, oh, so dumb.
8483	-0.266666666667	It's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in Invincible and overlook its drawbacks.
8484	-1.86666666667	Lazily directed by Charles Stone III ... from a leaden script by Matthew Cirulnick and novelist Thulani Davis.
8485	-1.06666666667	Though Jones and Snipes are enthralling, the movie bogs down in rhetoric and cliché.
8486	-1.46666666667	The most remarkable (and frustrating) thing about World Traveler, which opens today in Manhattan, is that its protagonist, after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes, remains a complete blank.
8487	-2.2	An artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art.
8488	-2.2	The pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs.
8489	-1.8	With lines that feel like long soliloquies    even as they are being framed in conversation    Max is static, stilted.
8490	-2.8	Barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest, your imagination, your empathy or anything, really, save your disgust and your indifference.
8491	0.222222222222	Writer/director Burr Steers emphasizes the Q in Quirky, with mixed results.
8492	-1.05555555556	One senses in World Traveler and in his earlier film that Freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers, and circles it obsessively, without making contact.
8493	0.166666666667	In between the icy stunts, the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and 'just letting the mountain tell you what to do.'
8494	-1.05555555556	The obligatory break ups and hook ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters.
8495	-2.44444444444	Make no mistake, ivans xtc. is a mess.
8496	-2.88888888889	Hypnotically dull, relentlessly downbeat, laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen year old's suicidal poetry.
8497	-2.0	The concept is a hoot. The trailer is a riot. The movie is a dud.
8498	-1.22222222222	It's a boring movie about a boring man, made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring.
8499	-2.66666666667	Because the intelligence level of the characters must be low, very low, very very low, for the masquerade to work, the movie contains no wit, only labored gags.
8500	-2.16666666667	It's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie.
8501	-0.944444444444	Some stunning visuals    and some staggeringly boring cinema.
8502	-1.5	These characters become wearisome.
8503	-0.833333333333	A hit  and miss affair, consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as Cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped.
8504	-1.44444444444	This may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar.
8505	-1.33333333333	Kim Ki Deok seems to have in mind an (emotionally at least) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested.
8506	-0.0555555555556	A sterling film   a cross between Boys Don't Cry, Deliverance, and Ode to Billy Joe   lies somewhere in the story of Matthew Shepard, but that film is yet to be made.
8507	-2.33333333333	After sitting through this sloppy, made for movie comedy special, it makes me wonder if Lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work.
8508	-1.83333333333	Contrived pastiche of caper clichés.
8509	-1.16666666667	Many shallower movies these days seem too long, but this one is egregiously short.
8510	-1.5	Just a Kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people. But it is set in a world that is very, very far from the one most of us inhabit.
8511	-2.88888888889	The most ill conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog Rover Dangerfield.
8512	-2.22222222222	Like shave ice without the topping, this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless.
8513	-1.61111111111	Despite its sincere acting, Signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype.
8514	-1.5	Yet another movie which presumes that high school social groups are at war, let alone conscious of each other's existence.
8515	-2.33333333333	Loud, chaotic and largely unfunny.
8516	-1.5	I can't remember the last time I saw an audience laugh so much during a movie, but there's only one problem...it's supposed to be a drama.
8517	-1.5	Qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating.
8518	-1.33333333333	Well, Jason's gone to Manhattan and Hell, I guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels (hey, don't shoot the messenger).
8519	-1.83333333333	Donovan ... squanders his main asset, Jackie Chan, and fumbles the vital action sequences.
8520	-1.83333333333	There is no psychology here, and no real narrative logic    just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities, which become strangely impersonal and abstract.
8521	-0.888888888889	Bread, My Sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it. It may even fall into the category of Films You Love to Hate. I admit it, I hate to like it.
8522	-0.277777777778	Frida is certainly no disaster, but neither is it the Kahlo movie Frida fans have been looking for.
8523	-1.5	Leaks treacle from every pore.
8524	-2.0	The characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue CIA assassins working for Chris Cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac, we don't feel much for Damon/Bourne or his predicament.
8525	-1.5	Kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities.
8526	-0.5	While we want MacDowell's character to retrieve her husband, we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her.
8527	-1.33333333333	Blue Crush is as predictable as the tides. ... The movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies.
8528	-1.33333333333	If you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you aren't very bright, then Blood Work is for you.
8529	-1.16666666667	Trouble Every Day is a success in some sense, but it's hard to like a film so cold and dead.
8530	0.111111111111	The film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design.
8531	-0.555555555556	A well intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility.
8532	-0.777777777778	A family friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise.
8533	-1.05555555556	A plodding look at the French Revolution through the eyes of aristocrats.
8534	-0.666666666667	Tom Shadyac has learned a bit more craft since directing Adams, but he still lingers over every point until the slowest viewer grasps it.

8536	-0.333333333333	A fast paced, glitzy but extremely silly piece.
8537	-2.33333333333	Any reasonably creative eighth grader could have written a more credible script, though with the same number of continuity errors.
8538	-1.55555555556	...while the humor aspects of 'Jason X' were far more entertaining than I had expected, everything else about the film tanks.
8539	-0.722222222222	Your taste for Jonah   A Veggie Tales Movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the Holy Spirit.
8540	-0.944444444444	Like an Afterschool Special with costumes by Gianni Versace, Mad Love looks better than it feels.
8541	-1.0	While certain cues, like the happy music, suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts, Jeong Hyang Lee's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness.
8542	-1.77777777778	The script, the gags, the characters are all direct to video stuff, and that's where this film should have remained.
8543	-1.55555555556	A thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions.
8544	-1.38888888889	A collage of clichés and a dim echo of allusions to other films.
8545	-1.27777777778	The film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper thin supporting characters.
8546	-0.111111111111	Jonah is only so so... the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you, or it will lessen it.
8547	-2.38888888889	An excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay.
8548	-2.11111111111	How many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring, self important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other?
8549	-0.555555555556	There are some laughs in this movie, but Williams' anarchy gets tiresome, the satire is weak.
8550	-1.44444444444	As steamy as last week's pork dumplings.
8551	-1.35294117647	The somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make Green Dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment.
8552	-1.58823529412	The filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they won't much care about.
8553	-2.52941176471	Another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing, moldering pile of, well, extreme stunt pictures.
8554	-2.41176470588	This strenuously unfunny Showtime deserves the hook.
8555	-1.58823529412	The whole thing's fairly lame, making it par for the course for Disney sequels.
8556	-0.941176470588	...its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself.
8557	-1.58823529412	...the good and different idea (of middle aged romance) is not handled well and, except for the fine star performances, there is little else to recommend ''Never Again.''
8558	-2.41176470588	If Disney's Cinderella proved that 'a dream is a wish your heart makes,' then Cinderella II proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio's wallet makes.
8559	-2.70588235294	Features nonsensical and laughable plotting, wooden performances, ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory.
8560	-1.0	With Rare Birds, as with The Shipping News before it, an attempt is made to transplant a Hollywood star into Newfoundland's wild soil    and The Rock once again resists the intrusion.
8561	-2.94117647059	Nothing about this movie works.
8562	-2.17647058824	If the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you, the simplistic Heaven will quite likely be more like hell.
8563	-1.47058823529	A spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged.
8564	-1.41176470588	None of Birthday Girl's calculated events take us by surprise...
8565	-0.176470588235	Are monsters born, or made?
8566	-1.94117647059	Lisa Rinzler's cinematography may be lovely, but Love Liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout, maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension.
8567	-1.64705882353	The narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures Esther, but she's never seen speaking on stage; one feels cheated, and Esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard.
8568	-1.64705882353	It's exactly the kind of movie Toback's detractors always accuse him of making.
8569	-2.17647058824	With the dog days of August upon us, think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity.
8570	-1.94117647059	Less about Shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw Quentin Tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo witty copycat interpretations.
8571	-2.35294117647	The film is like sitting in a downtown café, overhearing a bunch of typical late twenty somethings natter on about nothing, and desperately wishing you could change tables.
8572	-2.11764705882	This rather unfocused, all over the map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens... or if it were subtler... or if it had a sense of humor.
8573	-1.23529411765	Takes a clunky TV movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated Irish playwright, poet and drinker.
8574	-2.29411764706	Not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle of the road mainstream, it also represents glossy Hollywood at its laziest.
8575	-2.76470588235	A shame that Stealing Harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating, boring, and forgettable.
8576	-2.64705882353	Nearly every attempt at humor here is DOA.
8577	-2.17647058824	Collapses under its own meager weight.
8578	-1.52941176471	This is mild mannered, been there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant, the outrageous.
8579	-0.823529411765	If you adored The Full Monty so resoundingly that you're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting, then this should keep you reasonably entertained.
8580	-2.47058823529	Technically and artistically inept.
8581	-1.63157894737	Those who are only mildly curious, I fear, will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals.
8582	-1.47368421053	Though Tom Shadyac's film kicks off spookily enough, around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance.
8583	-2.31578947368	A long, dull procession of despair, set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral.
8584	-2.15789473684	Call me a cold hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie, but I believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid.
8585	-3.21052631579	Death might be a release.
8586	-2.63157894737	''(Hopkins)doesn't so much phone in his performance as fax it. No, even that's too committed. He gets his secretary to fax it.''
8587	-2.10526315789	Sodden and glum, even in those moments where it's supposed to feel funny and light.
8588	-2.26315789474	Priggish, lethargically paced parable of renewal.
8589	-1.42105263158	A beautifully shot but dull and ankle deep 'epic.'
8590	-1.47368421053	Even with its $50 million US budget, Pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture.
8591	-1.36842105263	This is a third person story now, told by Hollywood, and much more ordinary for it.
8592	-0.684210526316	The filmmakers know how to please the eye, but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story.
8593	-1.89473684211	Written, flatly, by David Kendall and directed, barely, by There's Something About Mary co writer Ed Decter.
8594	-0.894736842105	The characters are interesting and the relationship between Yosuke and Saeko is worth watching as it develops, but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours.
8595	0.263157894737	Very well made, but doesn't generate a lot of tension.
8596	-0.526315789474	Like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone. You leave the same way you came    a few tasty morsels under your belt, but no new friends.
8597	-2.10526315789	It's depressing to see how far Herzog has fallen.
8598	-2.63157894737	The question hanging over The Time Machine is not, as the main character suggests, 'what if?' but rather, 'How can you charge money for this?'
8599	-1.42105263158	Millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry.
8600	-1.31578947368	''Freaky Friday,'' it's not.
8601	-2.36842105263	Perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced, false and fabricated.
8602	-2.10526315789	Although no pastry is violated, this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch fests    farts, boobs, unmentionables    without much success.
8603	-1.21052631579	In this film, Aussie David Caesar channels the not quite dead career of Guy Ritchie.
8604	-3.21052631579	Maybe you'll be lucky, and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back.
8605	-1.78947368421	The characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity, with the ironic exception of Scooter.
8606	-2.36842105263	This film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers. For the rest of us, sitting through Dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment.
8607	-1.57894736842	Narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself.
8608	-2.05263157895	Somewhere inside the mess that is World Traveler, there is a mediocre movie trying to get out.
8609	-1.36842105263	A tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship.
8610	-1.36842105263	Its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand off, with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid section of the film.
8611	-1.47058823529	An artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike.
8612	-2.11764705882	The movie's ultimate point    that everyone should be themselves    is trite, but the screenwriter and director Michel Gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness.
8613	-1.47058823529	A glossy knock off of a B movie revenge flick.
8614	-2.88235294118	... expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse, turning into a black hole of dullness, from which no interesting concept can escape.
8615	-2.23529411765	It's just plain boring.
8616	-1.29411764706	Sad nonsense, this. But not without cheesy fun factor.
8617	-1.52941176471	One of those decades spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time.
8618	-0.411764705882	Really dumb but occasionally really funny.
8619	-1.35294117647	The movie wavers between Hallmark card sentimentality and goofy, life affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial.
8620	-1.58823529412	The director's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that's low on both suspense and payoff.
8621	-1.17647058824	While the transgressive trappings (especially the frank sex scenes) ensure that the film is never dull, Rodrigues's beast within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought, making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative.
8622	-2.23529411765	The satire is unfocused, while the story goes nowhere.
8623	-1.47058823529	They threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans.
8624	-2.11764705882	It's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of Action Man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of (Woo's) best work.
8625	-0.823529411765	Reyes' directorial debut has good things to offer, but ultimately it's undone by a sloppy script
8626	-2.11764705882	If you're over 25, have an IQ over 90, and have a driver's license, you should be able to find better entertainment.
8627	-1.41176470588	The darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil.
8628	-0.941176470588	...the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine.
8629	-1.05882352941	Never does ''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' reach the emotion or timelessness of Disney's great past, or even that of more recent successes such as ''Mulan'' or ''Tarzan.''
8630	-0.823529411765	One of those so so films that could have been much better.
8631	-1.70588235294	Crossroads feels like a teenybopper Ed Wood film, replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high strung but flaccid drama.
8632	-1.52941176471	Fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics, genre thrills or inherent humor.
8633	-1.41176470588	Interview With the Assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic, and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its Blair Witch Project real time roots.
8634	-1.35294117647	Cacoyannis' vision is far less mature, interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts.
8635	-2.05882352941	It has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie, which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline.
8636	-2.17647058824	It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept.
8637	-1.70588235294	Less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice Belgian waffle.
8638	-1.35294117647	It's not helpful to listen to extremist name calling, regardless of whether you think Kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self promoter.
8639	-2.17647058824	Abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed. The only problem is that, by the end, no one in the audience or the film seems to really care.
8640	0.764705882353	No Such Thing is sort of a minimalist Beauty and the Beast, but in this case the Beast should definitely get top billing. Robert John Burke as The Monster horns in and steals the show.
8641	-2.5	Due to stodgy, soap opera ish dialogue, the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a TelePrompTer.
8642	-1.6875	(T)he film is never sure to make a clear point – even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation.
8643	0.375	While it may not add up to the sum of its parts, Holofcener's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded, and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often.
8644	-0.9375	An overwrought Taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed up relationship.
8645	-2.625	Nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it, from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last minute, haphazard theatrical release.
8646	-3.625	A thoroughly awful movie  dumb, narratively chaotic, visually sloppy...a weird amalgam of 'The Thing' and a geriatric 'Scream.'
8647	-1.9375	...another example of how Sandler is losing his touch.
8648	-2.3125	Nothing sticks, really, except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad, sordid universe of guns, drugs, avarice and damaged dreams.
8649	-2.0	What goes on for the 110 minutes of ''Panic Room'' is a battle of witlessness between a not so bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals.
8650	-1.9375	The plot's contrivances are uncomfortably strained.
8651	-2.6875	Guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this: it's not scary in the slightest.
8652	-1.875	Schnieder bounces around with limp wrists, wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers, twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs...
8653	-1.5	Its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this isn't something to be taken seriously, but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare.
8654	-1.25	By the final whistle you're convinced that this Mean Machine was a decent TV outing that just doesn't have big screen magic.
8655	-3.3125	To say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor.
8656	-2.125	A film of empty, fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun.
8657	-0.375	Pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away. It's fun, but it's a real howler.
8658	-1.0625	Some fine acting, but ultimately a movie with no reason for being.
8659	-1.25	It's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie, beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting.
8660	-2.5	A waterlogged version of 'Fatal Attraction' for the teeny bopper set...a sad, soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads.
8661	-1.6875	It tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did.
8662	-3.5	Sweet gentle Jesus, did the screenwriters just do a cut and paste of every bad action movie line in history?
8663	-1.75	It's not the worst comedy of the year, but it certainly won't win any honors.
8664	-2.3125	This is for the most part a useless movie, even with a great director at the helm.
8665	-2.5625	A loud, witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the TV series.
8666	-2.0	Even on its own ludicrous terms, The Sum of All Fears generates little narrative momentum, and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the Ryan series.
8667	-1.4375	Though it inspires some (out of field) creative thought, the film is    to its own detriment    much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract.
8668	-2.75	As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters Generals game, Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy in a dress genre, and a personal low for everyone involved.
8669	-2.625	Sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes, masturbation jokes, and racist Japanese jokes.
8670	-1.75	Where Tom Green stages his gags as assaults on America's knee jerk moral sanctimony, Jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval.
8671	-0.285714285714	More of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller.
8672	-0.666666666667	The April 2002 instalment of the American War for Independence, complete with loads of CGI and bushels of violence, but not a drop of human blood.
8673	-1.47619047619	Contains all the substance of a Twinkie    easy to swallow, but scarcely nourishing.
8674	-0.904761904762	Return to Neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run of the mill Disney sequel intended for the home video market.
8675	-2.85714285714	Rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along.
8676	-2.57142857143	It's a thin notion, repetitively stretched out to feature length, awash in self consciously flashy camera effects, droning house music and flat, flat dialogue.
8677	-1.09523809524	On a certain base level, Blue Crush delivers what it promises, just not well enough to recommend it.
8678	-1.38095238095	The colorful Masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of Ganesh's rise up the social ladder.
8679	-2.61904761905	... an incredibly heavy handed, manipulative dud that feels all too familiar.
8680	-1.7619047619	Wimps out by going for that PG 13 rating, so the more graphic violence is mostly off screen and the sexuality is muted.
8681	-0.857142857143	Trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'What if?' scenario that will give most parents pause... Then, something terrible happens.
8682	-2.04761904762	Madonna has made herself over so often now, there's apparently nothing left to work with, sort of like Michael Jackson's nose.
8683	-2.09523809524	Never having seen the first two films in the series, I can't compare Friday After Next to them, but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days.
8684	-2.33333333333	The story is lacking any real emotional impact, and the plot is both contrived and cliched.
8685	-3.14285714286	A depraved, incoherent, instantly disposable piece of hackery.
8686	-2.57142857143	It's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring.
8687	-1.42857142857	(Soderbergh) tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence, and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness.
8688	0.0952380952381	Handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism.
8689	-1.95238095238	So aggressively cheery that Pollyana would reach for a barf bag.
8690	-1.57142857143	Scooby Doo doesn't know if it wants to be a retro refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly, Nickelodeon esque kiddie flick.
8691	-1.57142857143	Russell lacks the visual panache, the comic touch, and perhaps the budget of Sommers's title bout features.
8692	-2.04761904762	Highly uneven and inconsistent ... Margarita Happy Hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within.
8693	-3.33333333333	Very stupid and annoying.
8694	-2.0	The Sum of All Fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism, but it's really nothing more than warmed over Cold War paranoia.
8695	-2.90476190476	A listless and desultory affair.
8696	-2.33333333333	Represents the depths to which the girls behaving badly film has fallen.
8697	-2.61904761905	How inept is Serving Sara? It makes even Elizabeth Hurley seem graceless and ugly.
8698	-0.666666666667	Jam packed with literally bruising jokes. Every five minutes or so, someone gets clocked.
8699	-2.61904761905	Wins my vote for 'The 2002 Enemy of Cinema' Award.
8700	-1.42857142857	Any Chekhov is better than no Chekhov, but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years.
8701	-1.35	Helmer Hudlin tries to make a hip comedy, but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome.
8702	-3.35	Lazy, miserable and smug. This is one of the biggest disappointments of the year.
8703	-2.65	Formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market.
8704	-2.3	Every visual joke is milked, every set up obvious and lengthy, every punchline predictable. There's no energy.
8705	-1.85	Apparently writer director Attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film.
8706	-1.75	After the setup, the air leaks out of the movie, flattening its momentum with about an hour to go.
8707	-0.85	This is a poster movie, a mediocre tribute to films like Them!
8708	-1.2	At three hours and with very little story or character development, there is plenty of room for editing, and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother, more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue.
8709	-1.15	A bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be.
8710	-1.3	A crude teen oriented variation on a theme that the playwright Craig Lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his Prelude to a Kiss.
8711	-0.5	The film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings, especially in the last few cloying moments.
8712	-1.8	If you recognize Zeus (the dog from Snatch) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one.
8713	-3.05	This is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself, 'Ah, yes, here we have a bad, bad, bad movie.'
8714	-0.8	Shanghai Ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story, but you might want to think twice before booking passage.
8715	-1.25	Plays like a checklist of everything Rob Reiner and his cast were sending up.
8716	-1.7	There's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie, about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present.
8717	-0.8	It's at once laughable and compulsively watchable, in its committed dumbness.
8718	-1.75	All the sensuality, all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been, pardon the pun, sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness.
8719	0.0	A cross between Blow and Boyz N The Hood, this movie strives to be more, but doesn't quite get there. Good performances keep it from being a total rehash.
8720	-1.45	The screenplay is hugely overwritten, with tons and tons of dialogue    most of it given to children.
8721	-1.4	Troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal.
8722	-1.2	At times, the movie looks genuinely pretty. Your nightmares, on the other hand, will be anything but. Not even Felinni would know what to make of this Italian freakshow.
8723	-2.15	Elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke. If you're looking for a tale of Brits behaving badly, watch Snatch again. It's 51 times better than this.
8724	-2.1	It's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in Slackers or their antics amusing, let alone funny.
8725	-1.35	Despite its promising cast of characters, Big Trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that 'zany' doesn't necessarily mean 'funny.'
8726	-2.15	Both shrill and soporific, and because everything is repeated five or six times, it can seem tiresomely simpleminded.
8727	-1.35	Does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny.
8728	-1.55	Neither revelatory nor truly edgy  merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored.
8729	-0.85	Just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting. There are a few modest laughs, but certainly no thrills.
8730	-1.85	Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur.
8731	-0.736842105263	There's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling, which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title.
8732	-1.31578947368	While Howard's appreciation of Brown and his writing is clearly well meaning and sincere, the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast.
8733	-1.57894736842	A preposterous, prurient whodunit.
8734	-1.63157894737	Go, girls, right down the reality drain.
8735	-2.63157894737	Boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory, Impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie.
8736	-1.42105263158	Can be classified as one of those 'alternate reality' movies... except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality.
8737	-0.578947368421	Predictable and cloying, though Brown Sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle.
8738	-3.68421052632	...unlikable, uninteresting, unfunny, and completely, utterly inept.
8739	-2.36842105263	The film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart, mind or humor of its own.
8740	-2.10526315789	An imponderably stilted and self consciously arty movie.
8741	-3.0	Muddled, melodramatic paranormal romance is an all time low for Kevin Costner.
8742	-1.94736842105	Too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash.
8743	-2.10526315789	Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that's neither original nor terribly funny.
8744	-1.42105263158	`Matrix' style massacres erupt throughout...but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with Kafka inspired philosophy.
8745	0.894736842105	At least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director, Charles Stone III.
8746	-1.57894736842	It all unfolds predictably, and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time, providing no real sense of suspense.
8747	-1.73684210526	Wanker Goths are on the loose! Run for your lives!
8748	-1.73684210526	Why would anyone cast the magnificent Jackie Chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects?
8749	-2.84210526316	A grating, emaciated flick.
8750	-2.31578947368	Unambitious writing emerges in the movie, using a plot that could have come from an animated movie screenwriting textbook.
8751	-1.52631578947	Presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency.
8752	-1.73684210526	We have poignancy jostling against farce, thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one liners, and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except, maybe, that it looks neat.
8753	-1.89473684211	According to the script, Grant and Bullock's characters are made for each other. But you'd never guess that from the performances.
8754	-2.05263157895	The animation merely serves up a predictable, maudlin story that swipes heavily from Bambi and The Lion King, yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies.
8755	-1.94736842105	Ararat feels like a book report
8756	-1.63157894737	Steve Oedekerk is, alas, no Woody Allen.
8757	-2.15789473684	A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen    loud, violent and mindless.
8758	-1.89473684211	An amalgam of The Fugitive, Blade Runner, and Total Recall, only without much energy or tension.
8759	-3.57894736842	The acting is amateurish, the cinematography is atrocious, the direction is clumsy, the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing.
8760	-1.57894736842	Shows that Jackie Chan is getting older, and that's something I would rather live in denial about
8761	-0.5625	With miscast leads, banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax, Killing Me Softly belongs firmly in the so bad it's good camp.
8762	-1.5625	Alas, the black and white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick.
8763	-1.375	The slapstick is labored, and the bigger setpieces flat.
8764	-0.875	This is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks.
8765	-2.0	The problem with the mayhem in Formula 51 is not that it's offensive, but that it's boring.
8766	-1.8125	Much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged, as if filmed directly from a television monitor, while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché.
8767	-1.375	the film never rises above a conventional, two dimension tale
8768	-2.0	Mark Wahlberg...may look classy in a '60s homage pokepie hat, but as a character he's dry, dry, dry.
8769	-1.125	Told in scattered fashion, the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject.
8770	-0.1875	The irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb; their performances could have    should have    been allowed to stand on their own.
8771	-0.3125	Now I can see why people thought I was too hard on ''The Mothman Prophecies''.
8772	-1.6875	If ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter, this is it. If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution, this is it.
8773	0.1875	With an unusual protagonist (a kilt wearing Jackson) and subject matter, the improbable ''Formula 51'' is somewhat entertaining, but it could have been much stronger.
8774	0.75	Sandra Bullock's best dramatic performance to date (is) almost enough to lift (this) thrill kill cat and mouser...above its paint by numbers plot.
8775	-0.875	A feel good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about.
8776	-0.9375	Adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick, although the more lascivious minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service.'
8777	-1.8125	This mistaken identity picture is so film culture referential that the final product is a ghost.
8778	-2.125	The picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment.
8779	-2.875	De Niro cries. You'll cry for your money back.
8780	-2.375	Slap me, I saw this movie.
8781	-1.875	(The kid's) just too bratty for sympathy, and as the film grows to its finale, his little changes ring hollow.
8782	-1.75	Behind the glitz, Hollywood is sordid and disgusting. Quelle surprise!
8783	-0.9375	Scherfig, who has had a successful career in TV, tackles more than she can handle.
8784	-1.375	Just consider what New Best Friend does not have, beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay.
8785	-1.4375	Oscar caliber cast doesn't live up to material
8786	-1.375	The problems of the people in Love in the Time of Money are hardly specific to their era. They just have problems, which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way.
8787	-1.6875	Carrying this wafer thin movie on his nimble shoulders, Chan wades through putrid writing, direction and timing with a smile that says, 'If I stay positive, maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures, Drunken Master.'
8788	-3.25	So putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film.
8789	-2.1875	In the end, the movie bogs down in insignificance, saying nothing about Kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate.
8790	-1.0625	Starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés.
8791	-1.62962962963	Sometimes makes less sense than the Bruckheimeresque American action flicks it emulates.
8792	-2.40740740741	One of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids, children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation.
8793	-2.74074074074	There's only one way to kill Michael Myers for good: stop buying tickets to these movies.
8794	-1.33333333333	'Rare Birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience.
8795	-3.44444444444	The movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive.
8796	-3.22222222222	Resident Evil is what comes from taking John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars and eliminating the beheadings. In other words, about as bad a film you're likely to see all year.
8797	-2.59259259259	Five screenwriters are credited with the cliché laden screenplay; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before.
8798	-2.25925925926	The whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of Bewitched that takes place during Spring Break.
8799	-1.07407407407	Well made but uninvolving, Bloodwork isn't a terrible movie, just a stultifyingly obvious one    an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery.
8800	-1.55555555556	So we got Ten Little Indians meets Friday the 13th by way of Clean and Sober, filmed on the set of Carpenter's The Thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of The Love Boat.
8801	-1.92592592593	The movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster.
8802	-1.25925925926	Kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults, provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people. 'Snow Dogs' has both.
8803	-1.62962962963	It's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full blooded film.
8804	0.407407407407	Wobbly Senegalese updating of ''Carmen'' which is best for the stunning star turn by Djeinaba Diop Gai
8805	-1.33333333333	It's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who doesn't think about percentages all day long.
8806	-0.111111111111	Ken Russell would love this. In one scene, we get a stab at soccer hooliganism, a double barreled rip off of Quentin Tarantino's climactic shootout    and Meat Loaf explodes.
8807	-2.74074074074	Bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies. This is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer.
8808	-2.33333333333	The premise of ''Abandon'' holds promise,... but its delivery is a complete mess.
8809	-1.77777777778	What could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special effects excess.
8810	-1.33333333333	A little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment, not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama, Monsoon Wedding serves mostly to whet one's appetite for the Bollywood films.
8811	-1.03703703704	Unless Bob Crane is someone of particular interest to you, this film's impressive performances and adept direction aren't likely to leave a lasting impression.
8812	-0.851851851852	The Rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer CGI effects.
8813	-0.62962962963	The bottom line with Nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series: Fans will undoubtedly enjoy it, and the uncommitted needn't waste their time on it.
8814	-1.81481481481	The lousy John Q all but spits out Denzel Washington's fine performance in the title role.
8815	-2.48148148148	The whole thing feels like a ruse, a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy    or, worse yet, nonexistent    ideas.
8816	-3.11111111111	What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is!
8817	-1.74074074074	The film is so packed with subplots involving the various Silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature film.
8818	-1.74074074074	Opera on film is never satisfactory. The art demands live viewing. The innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen.
8819	-1.74074074074	Despite all the closed door hanky panky, the film is essentially juiceless.
8820	-2.07407407407	It is parochial, accessible to a chosen few, standoffish to everyone else, and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
8821	-2.3125	The Sweetest Thing leaves an awful sour taste.
8822	-1.875	It's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay.
8823	-2.75	Terminally bland, painfully slow and needlessly confusing ... The movie, shot on digital videotape rather than film, is frequently indecipherable.
8824	-0.4375	As dumb and cheesy as they may be, the cartoons look almost Shakespearean    both in depth and breadth    after watching this digital effects heavy, supposed family friendly comedy.
8825	-2.0625	Aloof and lacks any real raw emotion, which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships.
8826	-2.0625	A low rent retread of the Alien pictures.
8827	-1.0	Serviceable at best, slightly less than serviceable at worst.
8828	-1.0625	Its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche.
8829	-1.9375	A big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on.
8830	-1.9375	The story has little wit and no surprises.
8831	-2.875	The Merchant Ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema, only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage.
8832	-2.0	What should have been a cutting Hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of Variety.
8833	-2.8125	Hey everybody, wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children's party clown gets violently gang raped? I didn't think so.
8834	-1.8125	A little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt.
8835	-2.875	(T)his slop doesn't even have potential as a cult film, as it's too loud to shout insults at the screen.
8836	-2.5	The movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane, carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh.
8837	-2.1875	...may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence. This Scarlet's letter is A...as in aimless, arduous, and arbitrary.
8838	-1.375	Plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp.
8839	-1.375	The central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest.
8840	-0.625	A modestly comic, modestly action oriented World War II adventure that, in terms of authenticity, is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight.
8841	-1.75	A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks.
8842	-1.6875	Just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another, making Ararat far more demanding than it needs to be.
8843	-1.3125	A little less extreme than in the past, with longer exposition sequences between them, and with fewer gags to break the tedium.
8844	-1.5625	There's a heavy stench of 'been there, done that' hanging over the film. It's everything you'd expect    but nothing more.
8845	-1.5625	The biggest problem with Satin Rouge is Lilia herself. She's a cipher, played by an actress who smiles and frowns but doesn't reveal an inner life.
8846	1.0	A quaint, romanticized rendering.
8847	-1.5625	What with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background, you may mistake Love Liza for an Adam Sandler Chanukah song.
8848	-2.1875	The movie's heavy handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness.
8849	-2.125	A potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted.
8850	-2.25	Woody Allen used to ridicule movies like Hollywood Ending. Now he makes them.
8851	-1.42857142857	She's not yet an actress, not quite a singer...
8852	-1.0	Not a bad premise, but the execution is lackluster at best.
8853	-1.38095238095	Been there done that.
8854	-2.0	There is only so much baked cardboard I need to chew.
8855	-1.80952380952	A movie like The Guys is why film criticism can be considered work.
8856	0.047619047619	Schnitzler's film has a great hook, some clever bits and well drawn, if standard issue, characters, but is still only partly satisfying.
8857	-2.28571428571	Even if it made its original release date last fall, it would've reeked of a been there, done that sameness.
8858	-1.90476190476	Only two fifths of a satisfying movie experience.
8859	-3.2380952381	A loud, ugly, irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target.
8860	-1.61904761905	A movie version of a paint by numbers picture. We can tell what it is supposed to be, but can't really call it a work of art.
8861	-0.428571428571	It's a brilliant, honest performance by Nicholson, but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic Kathy Bates turns up. Bravado Kathy!
8862	-1.71428571429	...Liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario. Too bad.
8863	-2.90476190476	You can thank me for this. I saw Juwanna Mann so you don't have to.
8864	-2.90476190476	Unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters, the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor, ethnic slurs.
8865	-1.7619047619	Basically, it's pretty but dumb.
8866	-1.7619047619	This romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in.
8867	-1.66666666667	Squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations, Burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare.
8868	-1.2380952381	There's a neat twist, subtly rendered, that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes, but Kang tacks on three or four more endings.
8869	-1.71428571429	Reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark, while Said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition. It has no affect on the Kurds, but it wore me down.
8870	-2.42857142857	The actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless, lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen.
8871	-2.57142857143	Co writer/director Jonathan Parker's attempts to fashion a Brazil like, hyper real satire fall dreadfully short.
8872	0.238095238095	If this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards, more power to it.
8873	-2.04761904762	A superfluous sequel...plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with': Everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place, but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find.
8874	-2.7619047619	If there's a heaven for bad movies, Deuces Wild is on its way.
8875	-2.14285714286	Comes off like a bad imitation of the Bard.
8876	-1.85714285714	What's missing in Murder by Numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour. Being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough.
8877	-2.57142857143	An uninspired preachy and clichéd war film.
8878	-3.57142857143	Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible.
8879	-2.2380952381	A movie that harps on media constructed 'issues' like whether compromise is the death of self... this Orgasm (won't be an) exceedingly memorable one for most people.
8880	-2.28571428571	Slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic    the film's biggest problem    and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by.
8881	-1.6875	If Festival in Cannes nails hard  boiled Hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy, much about the film, including some of its casting, is frustratingly unconvincing.
8882	-1.3125	The movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value.
8883	-2.6875	I haven't seen such self amused trash since Freddy Got Fingered.
8884	-0.875	Little more than a well mounted history lesson.
8885	-2.1875	Rob Schneider's infantile cross dressing routines fill The Hot Chick, the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian.
8886	-3.4375	A horrible, 99 minute stink bomb.
8887	-1.5625	The film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly, wise and knowing or downright comically evil.
8888	-3.25	The film is so bad it doesn't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen.
8889	-1.375	Sheridan's take on the author's schoolboy memoir ... is a rather toothless take on a hard young life.
8890	-1.625	It jumps around with little logic or continuity, presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular, anciently demanding métier.
8891	-2.4375	How I Killed My Father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt    only it never melts.
8892	-1.3125	When it comes to the battle of Hollywood vs. Woo, it looks like Woo's a P.O.W.
8893	-1.1875	There are a few chuckles, but not a single gag sequence that really scores, and the stars seem to be in two different movies.
8894	-0.6875	The Chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones, but all it amounts to is a mildly funny, sometimes tedious, ultimately insignificant film.
8895	-2.4375	It's dull, spiritless, silly and monotonous: an ultra loud blast of pointless mayhem, going nowhere fast.
8896	-0.1875	The mushy finale turns John Q into a movie of the week tearjerker.
8897	-1.0625	Content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger   all for easy sanctimony, formulaic thrills and a ham fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance.
8898	-0.5	The movie turns out to be (Assayas') homage to the Gallic 'tradition of quality,' in all its fusty squareness.
8899	0.4375	Its message has merit and, in the hands of a brutally honest individual like Prophet Jack, might have made a point or two regarding life.
8900	-2.5625	(Seems) even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money grubbing than most third rate horror sequels.
8901	-2.125	It's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread.
8902	-0.9375	Neither as scary funny as Tremors nor demented funny as Starship Troopers, the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price.
8903	-0.875	If swimfan does catch on, it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh.
8904	-1.375	What might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors.
8905	-1.1875	The Master of Disguise may have made a great Saturday Night Live sketch, but a great movie it is not.
8906	-1.6875	It's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the Cannes Film Festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere.
8907	-1.25	Boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step printing to goose things up, but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect.
8908	-2.125	It's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to    or offer any new insight into    its chosen topic. Unfortunately, that's precisely what Arthur Dong's Family Fundamentals does.
8909	-1.1875	Has the marks of a septuagenarian; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick.
8910	-0.9375	Like a medium grade network sitcom  mostly inoffensive, fitfully amusing, but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen.
8911	-1.44444444444	Something must have been lost in the translation.
8912	-1.94444444444	Becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any Plympton film: boring.
8913	-1.94444444444	In the end, the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived, as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose tinted glasses.
8914	-1.5	Chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action comedy.
8915	-1.27777777778	Rock's stand up magic wanes. Hopkins, squarely fills the screen. Action   mechanical.
8916	-1.5	''The Tuxedo'' should have been the vehicle for Chan that ''The Mask'' was for Jim Carrey. Alas, it's the man that makes the clothes.
8917	-2.11111111111	For casual moviegoers who stumble into Rules expecting a slice of American Pie hijinks starring the kid from Dawson's Creek, they'll probably run out screaming.
8918	-1.66666666667	The biggest problem I have (other than the very sluggish pace) is we never really see her Esther blossom as an actress, even though her talent is supposed to be growing.
8919	-1.38888888889	What puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in Britney Spears' first movie.
8920	-2.05555555556	Plot, characters, drama, emotions, ideas    all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing The Scorpion King.
8921	-1.66666666667	City by the Sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for. But how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery.
8922	-2.16666666667	Whatever the movie's sentimental, hypocritical lessons about sexism, its true colors come out in various wet T shirt and shower scenes.
8923	-1.05555555556	As a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery, Murder by Numbers fits the profile too closely.
8924	-2.5	There ain't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it's hilarious.
8925	-0.833333333333	I enjoyed the movie in a superficial way, while never sure what its purpose was.
8926	-1.72222222222	What a pity ... that the material is so second rate.
8927	-1.55555555556	Doesn't deliver a great story, nor is the action as gripping as in past Seagal films.
8928	-2.61111111111	The kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill advised and poorly executed idea.
8929	-0.944444444444	Nicks refuses to let Slackers be seen as just another teen movie, which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross out comedy.
8930	-2.38888888889	Nothing about the film    with the possible exception of Elizabeth Hurley's breasts    is authentic.
8931	-1.77777777778	Amid the cliché and foreshadowing, Cage manages a degree of casual realism ... that is routinely dynamited by Blethyn.
8932	-1.61111111111	Mostly, Shafer and co writer Gregory Hinton lack a strong minded viewpoint, or a sense of humor.
8933	-2.05555555556	No cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces Wild.
8934	-1.66666666667	Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson have a cute partnership in I Spy, but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good.
8935	-2.27777777778	Strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression.
8936	-1.55555555556	There's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life, but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes.
8937	-2.33333333333	It's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character, especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as Phoenix's.
8938	-1.61111111111	There's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids' movie ... that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where Santa gives gifts to grownups.
8939	-1.83333333333	We're left with a story that tries to grab us, only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments.
8940	-1.44444444444	Like many such biographical melodramas, it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories.
8941	-2.5	There is nothing redeeming about this movie.
8942	-1.11111111111	The film has (its) moments, but they are few and far between.
8943	-1.94444444444	I was trying to decide what annoyed me most about God is Great... I'm Not, and then I realized that I just didn't care.
8944	-1.88888888889	Derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone.
8945	-0.277777777778	Deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits.
8946	-0.111111111111	... comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental.
8947	-0.666666666667	Brosnan's finest non Bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes.
8948	-0.0555555555556	A film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms, Waiting for Happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact.
8949	-2.0	To me, it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence, with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy.
8950	-0.944444444444	Tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often.
8951	-1.27777777778	Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool, but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding Equilibrium up.
8952	-0.555555555556	ZigZag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted.
8953	-1.72222222222	How can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing? In truth, it has all the heart of a porno flick (but none of the sheer lust).
8954	-0.944444444444	Nicks and Steinberg match their own creations for pure venality    that's giving it the old college try.
8955	-1.27777777778	Episode II   Attack of the Clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight.
8956	-1.94444444444	The problem with all of this: It's not really funny.
8957	-1.27777777778	(Denis') bare bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product.
8958	-1.33333333333	Wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically, and borrows heavily from Lynch, Jeunet, and von Trier while failing to find a spark of its own.
8959	-1.77777777778	Viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some Freudian puppet.
8960	-0.722222222222	Overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste.
8961	-1.44444444444	The mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick.' Translation: 'We don't need to try very hard.'
8962	-2.5	In all the annals of the movies, few films have been this odd, inexplicable and unpleasant.
8963	-1.83333333333	It takes a really long, slow and dreary time to dope out what TUCK EVERLASTING is about. So here it is: It's about a family of sour immortals.
8964	-1.38888888889	an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we've been watching for decades
8965	-0.444444444444	The author's devotees will probably find it fascinating; others may find it baffling.
8966	-1.5	Writer director Walter Hill and co writer David Giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches, but wind up using them as punching bags.
8967	-1.61111111111	There's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed: Mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up; when the explosions start, they fall to pieces.
8968	-1.61111111111	A cockeyed shot all the way.
8969	-0.666666666667	Lush and beautifully photographed (somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book), but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered.
8970	-2.05555555556	Unfortunately, One Hour Photo lives down to its title. Thanks largely to Williams, all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes    the rest is just an overexposed waste of film.
8971	-3.04761904762	Cold, Sterile And Lacking Any Color Or Warmth.
8972	-2.14285714286	The film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold.
8973	-1.61904761905	Seems like someone going through the motions.
8974	-1.85714285714	For a film about explosions and death and spies, ''Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever'' seems as safe as a children's film. Well, in some of those, the mother deer even dies.
8975	-1.57142857143	Wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times, and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste.
8976	-1.33333333333	Impostor doesn't do much with its template, despite a remarkably strong cast.
8977	-1.66666666667	Wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy, but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean spirited.
8978	-1.85714285714	Choppy, overlong documentary about 'The Lifestyle.'
8979	-2.85714285714	One sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot.
8980	-1.7619047619	A film which presses familiar Herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction, when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised.
8981	-0.952380952381	It's a fanboy 'what if?' brought to life on the big screen.
8982	-1.95238095238	The story itself is actually quite vapid.
8983	-3.2380952381	It's a hellish, numbing experience to watch, and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already, back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid '90s.
8984	-0.238095238095	Wait for pay per view or rental but don't dismiss BarberShop out of hand.
8985	-1.61904761905	A few zingers aside, the writing is indifferent, and Jordan Brady's direction is prosaic.
8986	-2.52380952381	Each scene drags, underscoring the obvious, and sentiment is slathered on top.
8987	-1.90476190476	Would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story, and left off the film's predictable denouement. Then Nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all.
8988	-1.42857142857	One of those staggeringly well produced, joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next, hastily, emptily.
8989	-2.38095238095	Nair just doesn't have the necessary self control to guide a loose, poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy.
8990	0.238095238095	Enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions, Walt Becker's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons.
8991	1.57142857143	It's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge.
8992	-1.7619047619	That neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions, defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks.
8993	-2.42857142857	What starts off as a possible Argentine American Beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers.
8994	-2.57142857143	The project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger Fatal Attraction into a high school setting.
8995	-1.52380952381	In old fashioned screenwriting parlance, Ms. Shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick,' despite the efforts of a first rate cast.
8996	-2.14285714286	Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
8997	-3.2380952381	Stitch is a bad mannered, ugly and destructive little ****. No cute factor here.... Not that I mind ugly; the problem is he has no character, loveable or otherwise.
8998	-3.57142857143	Deep down, I realized the harsh reality of my situation: I would leave the theater with a lower I.Q. than when I had entered.
8999	-1.57142857143	A really funny fifteen minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature length film.
9000	-3.14285714286	Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea, the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand.
9001	-0.666666666667	It is bad, but certainly not without merit as entertainment.
9002	-2.2	For its 100 minutes running time, you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen.
9003	-1.73333333333	A work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse.
9004	0.733333333333	A faster paced family flick. Upper Teens may get cynical. Smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy.
9005	-0.6	While this film has an 'A' list cast and some strong supporting players, the tale    like its central figure, Vivi    is just a little bit hard to love.
9006	-1.6	It's a road trip drama with too many wrong turns.
9007	-2.2	Most fish stories are a little peculiar, but this is one that should be thrown back in the river.
9008	-1.73333333333	It's all gratuitous before long, as if Schwentke were fulfilling a gross out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story.
9009	-2.0	''I blame all men for war,'' (the warden's daughter) tells her father. The movie is about as deep as that sentiment.
9010	-0.533333333333	It's fitfully funny but never really takes off.
9011	-2.33333333333	I've seen some bad singer turned actors, but Lil Bow Wow takes the cake.
9012	0.8	By halfway through this picture I was beginning to hate it, and, of course, feeling guilty for it.... Then, miracle of miracles, the movie does a flip flop.
9013	-1.26666666667	For all the complications, it's all surprisingly predictable.
9014	-1.46666666667	It's been 20 years since 48 Hrs. made Eddie Murphy a movie star and the man hasn't aged a day. But his showboating wise cracker stock persona sure is getting old.
9015	-2.2	If Deuces Wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure, one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good. But it wasn't.
9016	-2.13333333333	For a film about action, Ultimate X is the gabbiest giant screen movie ever, bogging down in a barrage of hype.
9017	-2.26666666667	...a low rate Annie featuring some kid who can't act, only echoes of Jordan, and weirdo actor Crispin Glover screwing things up old school.
9018	-2.4	It might not be 1970s animation, but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons – a retread story, bad writing, and the same old silliness.
9019	-1.2	The picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all male All About Eve or a lush, swooning melodrama in the Intermezzo strain.
9020	-1.93333333333	A nearly 21/2 hours, the film is way too indulgent.
9021	-1.0	Gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid...a curiously constricted epic.
9022	-1.46666666667	It looks much more like a cartoon in the end than The Simpsons ever has.
9023	-0.666666666667	With a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work, especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent, but as is, Personal Velocity seems to be idling in neutral.
9024	-1.46666666667	Doesn't really add up to much.
9025	-1.53333333333	It's better suited for the history or biography channel, but there's no arguing the tone of the movie   it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind.
9026	-2.2	An entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots.
9027	-2.13333333333	A prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp.
9028	-1.6	Borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion.
9029	-1.33333333333	It's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction.
9030	-2.53333333333	A chilly, remote, emotionally distant piece...so dull that its tagline should be: 'In space, no one can hear you snore.'
9031	-1.3125	The characters seem one dimensional, and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience.
9032	-1.4375	Sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish, and the film only really comes alive when poor Hermocrates and Leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours.
9033	-1.3125	It's like a drive by. You can drive right by it without noticing anything special, save for a few comic turns, intended and otherwise.
9034	-0.875	Everything    even life on an aircraft carrier    is sentimentalized.
9035	-2.5	This would be 'James Bond for the Extreme Generation' pic is one big, dumb action movie. Stress 'dumb.'
9036	-1.1875	The movie has generic virtues, and despite a lot of involved talent, seems done by the numbers.
9037	-1.5	When your subject is illusion versus reality, shouldn't the reality seem at least passably real?
9038	-3.6875	It's a terrible movie in every regard, and utterly painful to watch.
9039	-2.3125	This is rote spookiness, with nary an original idea (or role, or edit, or score, or anything, really) in sight, and the whole of the proceedings beg the question 'Why?'
9040	-1.625	A fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down.
9041	-1.875	Too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style.
9042	-2.3125	There's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming of age/coming out tale.
9043	-0.875	As much as I laughed throughout the movie, I cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment, or even performance art, although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain.
9044	-2.1875	The type of dumbed down exercise in stereotypes that gives the (teen comedy) genre a bad name.
9045	-2.25	Distinctly sub par...more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine.
9046	-2.4375	Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV's Dawson's Creek and a recycled and dumbed down version of Love Story.
9047	-1.125	Unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm, you're going to feel like you weren't invited to the party.
9048	-2.0625	When the casting call for this movie went out, it must have read 'seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame.'
9049	-1.0	Just isn't as weird as it ought to be.
9050	-1.5	A ''Home Alone'' film that is staged like ''Rosemary's Baby,'' but is not as well conceived as either of those films.
9051	-1.0625	(Siegel) and co writers Lisa Bazadona and Grace Woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround Frankie.
9052	-2.5625	No film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population.
9053	-0.875	`Hey Arnold!' has some visual wit ... but little imagination elsewhere.
9054	-1.375	They're going through the motions, but the zip is gone.
9055	-1.625	A sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women.
9056	-2.0	A low budget affair, Tadpole was shot on digital video, and the images often look smeary and blurry, to the point of distraction. Then again, in a better movie, you might not have noticed.
9057	-2.5	It's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like Punch Drunk Love.
9058	-1.75	The movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession, and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the ''webcast.''
9059	-0.9375	tale will be all too familiar for anyone who's seen George Roy Hill's 1973 film, ''The Sting.''
9060	-1.5	Gets the look and the period trappings right, but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichés.
9061	1.05	It's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles, but Notorious C.H.O. still feels like a promising work in progress.
9062	-0.5	Anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films, sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity.
9063	-1.35	The problem with The Bread, My Sweet is that it's far too sentimental.
9064	-0.75	A late night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques.
9065	-1.35	Falls short in explaining the music and its roots.
9066	-1.6	Never inspires more than an interested detachment.
9067	-2.15	What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks (at least during their '70s heyday) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature.
9068	-2.0	Despite slick production values and director Roger Michell's tick tock pacing, the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours.
9069	-2.25	Pretty much sucks, but has a funny moment or two.
9070	-0.8	They do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film.
9071	-2.25	A supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama. It ends up being neither, and fails at both endeavors.
9072	-2.4	Two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity.
9073	-1.95	It is so earnest, so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied.
9074	-1.0	These are textbook lives of quiet desperation.
9075	-1.9	Swimfan, like Fatal Attraction, eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub.
9076	-1.3	Claims to sort the bad guys from the good, which is its essential problem.
9077	-1.55	Purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore, if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons.
9078	-1.8	Feels like pieces a bunch of other, better movies slapped together.
9079	-2.4	Almost everything about the film is unsettling, from the preposterous hairpiece worn by Lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences.
9080	-2.9	Writer director Randall Wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew, and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic.
9081	-1.75	It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour, in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works, and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes.
9082	-2.15	One can't shake the feeling that Crossroads is nothing more than an hour and a half long commercial for Britney's latest album.
9083	-1.35	Phoned in business as usual.
9084	-0.75	There's an epic here, but you have to put it together yourself.
9085	-2.0	What little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting, macabre sets, and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else.
9086	0.0	Director chef Gabriele Muccino keeps it fast    zippy, comin' at ya    as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale.
9087	-0.7	Tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm, but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality.
9088	-3.6	The most horrific movie experience I've had since ''Can't Stop The Music.'' It may as well be called ''Jar Jar Binks: The Movie.'' It's that painful.
9089	-2.75	God is great, the movie's not.
9090	-1.85	Like a three ring circus, there are side stories aplenty    none of them memorable.
9091	-0.933333333333	When in doubt, the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack, throws in a fish out of water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip. Or else a doggie winks.
9092	-1.73333333333	A 'Girls Gone Wild' video for the boho art house crowd, The Burning Sensation isn't a definitive counter cultural document    its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that.
9093	-2.06666666667	As original and insightful as last week's episode of Behind the Music.
9094	-1.73333333333	Plays like John Le Carré with a couple of burnt out cylinders.
9095	-3.26666666667	You may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie.
9096	0.333333333333	It's neither as sappy as Big Daddy nor as anarchic as Happy Gilmore or The Waterboy, but it has its moments.
9097	0.2	Despite the surface attractions    Conrad L. Hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an Oscar next year    there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything.
9098	-1.13333333333	A smug and convoluted action comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie.
9099	-0.533333333333	(Crystal and De Niro) manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing.
9100	-3.26666666667	Worthless, from its pseudo rock video opening to the idiocy of its last frames.
9101	-1.8	The Christ allegory doesn't work because there is no foundation for it
9102	-0.733333333333	Go for La Salle's performance, and make do as best you can with a stuttering script.
9103	-2.26666666667	It's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful, self satisfied 22 year old girlfriend and an equally beautiful, self satisfied 18 year old mistress.
9104	-2.33333333333	Tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud, too goofy and too short of an attention span.
9105	-0.533333333333	I didn't find much fascination in the swinging. What they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games, of no erotic or sensuous charge. But that they are doing it is thought provoking.
9106	-1.4	The acting is just fine, but there's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes, especially with the weak payoff.
9107	-2.0	After Collateral Damage, you might imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned. But no.
9108	-2.33333333333	Ultimately the, yes, snail like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary, like some sort of Martha Stewart decorating program run amok.
9109	-2.73333333333	Releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in January lends itself to easy jokes and insults, and Snow Dogs deserves every single one of them.
9110	-2.06666666667	Tedious Norwegian offering which somehow snagged an Oscar nomination.
9111	-0.533333333333	It was a dark and stormy night...
9112	-2.06666666667	A dark as pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality, probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment.
9113	-1.4	This sort of cute and cloying material is far from Zhang's forte and it shows.
9114	-2.86666666667	Bray is completely at sea; with nothing but a Savage Garden music video on his resume, he has no clue about making a movie.
9115	-0.2	Freundlich's made (Crudup) a suburban architect, and a cipher.
9116	-2.93333333333	a huge disappointment coming, as it does, from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
9117	-1.93333333333	Though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers, it's exploitive without being insightful.
9118	-0.8	Aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups: very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters.
9119	-1.6	What starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points.
9120	-2.2	Exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera...more salacious telenovela than serious drama.
9121	-2.30769230769	Seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what's left of his passe' chopsocky glory.
9122	-1.38461538462	Even with Harris's strong effort, the script gives him little to effectively probe Lear's soul stripping breakdown.
9123	-2.69230769231	The story is bogus and its characters tissue thin.
9124	-2.53846153846	Whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as Pulp Fiction and Get Shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing, Who Is Cletis Tout? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche.
9125	-1.38461538462	While American Adobo has its heart (and its palate) in the right place, its brain is a little scattered    ditsy, even.
9126	-1.88461538462	Imagine a film that begins as a Seven rip off, only to switch to a mix of The Shining, The Thing, and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s.
9127	-2.96153846154	Most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears.
9128	-2.38461538462	Costner's warm milk persona is just as ill fitting as Shadyac's perfunctory directing chops, and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink Laurence Olivier.
9129	-1.11538461538	It's coherent, well shot, and tartly acted, but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate.
9130	-0.5	Directed by Kevin Bray, whose crisp framing, edgy camera work, and wholesale ineptitude with acting, tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut.
9131	-2.46153846154	turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film's characters
9132	-0.346153846154	Robin Williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role.
9133	-1.92307692308	High Crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor, a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors, Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd.
9134	-1.30769230769	Set in a 1986 Harlem that doesn't look much like anywhere in New York.
9135	-1.30769230769	The chocolate factory without Charlie.
9136	-1.61538461538	Long on twinkly eyed close ups and short on shame.
9137	-0.884615384615	Hip hop rarely comes alive as its own fire breathing entity in this picture.
9138	-2.03846153846	A dull, somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise.
9139	-2.92307692308	Deserving of its critical backlash and more.
9140	-1.23076923077	Neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment. Still, it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered.
9141	-1.69230769231	The Sum of All Fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context, which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots (or cinema seats).
9142	-1.0	The movie spends more time with Schneider than with newcomer McAdams, even though her performance is more interesting (and funnier) than his.
9143	-2.19230769231	This low rent    and even lower wit    rip off of the Farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy    and in a relatively short amount of time.
9144	-2.03846153846	It recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera.
9145	-2.19230769231	I'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business, but surely it doesn't have to be as a collection of keening and self mutilating sideshow geeks.
9146	-1.11538461538	May offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor.
9147	-1.5	Many of Benjamins' elements feel like they've been patched in from an episode of Miami Vice.
9148	-2.23076923077	It aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one.
9149	-0.653846153846	Most folks with a real stake in the American sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant.
9150	-1.84615384615	If you're not fans of the adventues of Steve and Terri, you should avoid this like the dreaded King Brown snake. Personally, I'd rather watch them on the Animal Planet.
9151	-2.23076923077	Cherish is a dud    a romantic comedy that's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny.
9152	-1.07692307692	Feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum.
9153	-1.96153846154	All of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue Brown Sugar from the curse of blandness.
9154	-1.30769230769	The movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating, though, even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance.
9155	-2.26923076923	...post September 11, ''The Sum Of All Fears'' seems more tacky and reprehensible, manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves.
9156	-2.57692307692	The exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you'll find in this dreary mess.
9157	-1.38461538462	No matter how you slice it, Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton are not Hepburn and Grant, two cinematic icons with chemistry galore.
9158	-2.5	Godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess...In Praise of Love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating.
9159	-3.03846153846	Humorless, self conscious art drivel, made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention.
9160	-2.80769230769	The movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error.'
9161	-1.76923076923	Solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say, but he isn't talking a talk that appeals to me.
9162	-1.73076923077	More tiring than anything.
9163	-2.34615384615	Nelson's intentions are good, but the end result does no justice to the story itself. It's horribly depressing and not very well done.
9164	-1.92307692308	...the efforts of its star, Kline, to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught.
9165	-1.07692307692	A good natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast, but never quite gets off the ground.
9166	-2.15384615385	Isn't it a bit early in his career for director Barry Sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself? And it's a lousy one at that.
9167	-1.69230769231	Overly long and worshipful bio doc.
9168	-2.46153846154	I'll go out on a limb. It isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year. It's just merely very bad.
9169	-1.76923076923	Writer director Ritchie reduces Wertmuller's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon.
9170	-0.269230769231	About Amy's cuteness, Amy's career success (she's a best selling writer of self help books who can't help herself), and Amy's neuroses when it comes to men.
9171	-1.80769230769	Everything about Girls Can't Swim, even its passages of sensitive observation, feels secondhand, familiar    and not in a good way.
9172	-1.26923076923	Feels aimless for much of its running time, until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives, leaving questions in its wake.
9173	-1.73076923077	In my own very humble opinion, In Praise of Love lacks even the most fragmented charms I have found in almost all of his previous works.
9174	-1.65384615385	The script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue.
9175	-2.03846153846	Muddled, simplistic and more than a little pretentious.
9176	-2.11538461538	Meandering and glacially paced, and often just plain dull.
9177	-2.07692307692	A disaster of a drama, saved only by its winged assailants.
9178	-2.0	A road trip that will get you thinking, 'Are we there yet?'
9179	-1.73076923077	Director Elie Chouraqui, who co wrote the script, catches the chaotic horror of war, but why bother if you're going to subjugate truth to the tear jerking demands of soap opera?
9180	-1.42307692308	Dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting, and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation.
9181	-1.6	If there was any doubt that Peter O'Fallon didn't have an original bone in his body, A Rumor of Angels should dispel it.
9182	-0.8	An occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten.
9183	-0.6	What could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in Steven Soderbergh's Traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination.
9184	-1.26666666667	The movie is like Scorsese's Mean Streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like Leather Warriors and Switchblade Sexpot.
9185	-2.26666666667	This pathetic junk is barely an hour long. Nevertheless, it still seems endless.
9186	-1.6	It isn't that Stealing Harvard is a horrible movie  if only it were that grand a failure! It's just that it's so not at all good. And I expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director Bruce McCulloch.
9187	-1.53333333333	Dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality    the one bald and the other sloppy.
9188	-1.66666666667	Is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it?
9189	-0.933333333333	It's supposed to be a romantic comedy   it suffers from too much Norma Rae and not enough Pretty Woman.
9190	-1.46666666667	The leads are so unmemorable, despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes, that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer's secondhand material.
9191	-1.46666666667	Staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce.
9192	-1.0	Not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days, but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired.
9193	-1.46666666667	Brainy, artistic and muted, almost to the point of suffocation.
9194	-1.6	Plays like the old disease of the week small screen melodramas.
9195	-1.13333333333	Like life on the island, the movie grows boring despite the scenery.
9196	-1.6	The truth about Charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project.
9197	-0.666666666667	displays the potential for a better movie than what Bailly manages to deliver
9198	-1.53333333333	So exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming.
9199	-1.4	An awkward hybrid of genres that just doesn't work.
9200	-0.733333333333	The latest vapid actor's exercise to appropriate the structure of Arthur Schnitzler's Reigen.
9201	-1.93333333333	Snipes is both a snore and utter tripe.
9202	-0.933333333333	Ritchie's film is easier to swallow than Wertmuller's polemical allegory, but it's self defeatingly decorous.
9203	-1.93333333333	Chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly.
9204	-2.26666666667	It's the kind of under inspired, overblown enterprise that gives Hollywood sequels a bad name.
9205	-1.73333333333	Rosenthal (Halloween II) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense.
9206	-1.26666666667	Even Murphy's expert comic timing and famed charisma can't rescue this effort.
9207	-1.13333333333	Rodriguez...was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight.
9208	-1.0	A sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions.
9209	-1.06666666667	Some Body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling.
9210	-0.2	This isn't a terrible film by any means, but it's also far from being a realized work.
9211	-1.33333333333	Apparently, romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just doesn't figure in the present Hollywood program.
9212	-2.94444444444	Depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived. Only masochistic moviegoers need apply.
9213	-1.16666666667	A movie that's held captive by mediocrity. Not bad, but not all that good. Bacon keeps things interesting, but don't go out of your way to pay full price.
9214	-1.66666666667	What's next? Rob Schneider, Dana Carvey and Sarah Michelle Gellar in The Philadelphia Story? David Spade as Citizen Kane?
9215	-1.66666666667	Can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center.
9216	-1.77777777778	The problem, amazingly enough, is the screenplay.
9217	-2.11111111111	It's a Frankenstein monster of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be.
9218	-2.11111111111	Upper West Sidey exercise in narcissism and self congratulation disguised as a tribute.
9219	-2.0	On its icy face, the new film is a subzero version of Monsters, Inc., without the latter's imagination, visual charm or texture.
9220	-1.27777777778	I can't say this enough: This movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies.
9221	-1.55555555556	It's a mindless action flick with a twist    far better suited to video viewing than the multiplex.
9222	-2.38888888889	After a while, the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through The Country Bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop music history has been allowed to get wet, fuzzy and sticky.
9223	-1.5	We get light showers of emotion a couple of times, but then    strangely    these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle.
9224	-2.72222222222	Summer's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this.
9225	-2.44444444444	The film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message, if indeed there is one.
9226	-2.16666666667	Often lingers just as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging, which gradually turns What Time Is It There? into How Long Is This Movie?
9227	-1.5	Too bad Kramer couldn't make a guest appearance to liven things up.
9228	-2.11111111111	Deuces Wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell to innocence movies like The Wanderers and A Bronx Tale without cribbing any of their intelligence.
9229	-2.44444444444	It's a barely tolerable slog over well trod ground.
9230	-2.16666666667	Epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made Tucker a star.
9231	-1.0	It's sweet... but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end.
9232	-3.11111111111	A dull, dumb and derivative horror film.
9233	-2.16666666667	An awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism.
9234	-1.55555555556	Demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his Charade remake, but he can't disguise that he's spiffing up leftovers that aren't so substantial or fresh.
9235	-0.944444444444	This is a heartfelt story ... it just isn't a very involving one.
9236	-2.22222222222	These self styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously, their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self preservation.
9237	-2.11111111111	The fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60 second homage to one of Demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it.
9238	-1.27777777778	Richard Pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material, but Lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold.
9239	-1.16666666667	The band performances featured in Drumline are red hot... (but) from a mere story point of view, the film's ice cold.
9240	-1.38888888889	... built on the premise that middle class Arkansas consists of monster truck loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from TV reruns and supermarket tabloids.
9241	-2.41176470588	A laughable    or rather, unlaughable    excuse for a film.
9242	-2.05882352941	The sequel is everything the original was not: contrived, overblown and tie in ready.
9243	-2.64705882353	Like a grinning Jack O' Lantern, its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy, having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded.
9244	-1.0	A sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity.
9245	-1.70588235294	...familiar and predictable, and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a Xerox machine rather than (writer director) Franc. Reyes' word processor.
9246	-1.41176470588	Give Shapiro, Goldman, and Bolado credit for good intentions, but there's nothing here that they couldn't have done in half an hour.
9247	-2.82352941176	It's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even Jason X ... look positively Shakesperean by comparison.
9248	-1.17647058824	A little objectivity could have gone a long way.
9249	-3.58823529412	One of the worst films of 2002.
9250	-1.17647058824	I believe Silberling had the best intentions here, but he just doesn't have the restraint to fully realize them.
9251	-1.88235294118	plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure Hollywood.
9252	-2.11764705882	McTiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet    the sober minded original was as graceful as a tap dancing rhino    but it is just as boring and as obvious.
9253	-1.52941176471	High Crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ Marine/legal mystery, and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff, nearly subliminally, as the old hat province of male intrigue.
9254	-2.94117647059	This movie is about the worst thing Chan has done in the United States.
9255	-2.0	The explosion essentially ruined    or, rather, overpowered    the fiction of the movie for me.
9256	-2.52941176471	This ludicrous film is predictable at every turn.
9257	-3.0	An incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people...manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy.
9258	-2.52941176471	The film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility.
9259	-1.94117647059	Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the X Games, we get a cinematic postcard that's superficial and unrealized.
9260	-2.47058823529	The crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise.
9261	-1.11764705882	I wish it would have just gone more over the top instead of trying to have it both ways.
9262	-1.47058823529	The superior plotline isn't quite enough to drag along the dead (water) weight of the other.
9263	-1.88235294118	The film doesn't really care about the thousands of Americans who die hideously, it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the CIA.
9264	-2.0	Adrift, Bentley and Hudson stare and sniffle, respectively, as Ledger attempts, in vain, to prove that movie star intensity can overcome bad hair design.
9265	-1.64705882353	After an hour and a half of wondering    sometimes amusedly, sometimes impatiently    just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be, you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be.
9266	-1.94117647059	'Linklater fans, or pretentious types who want to appear avant garde will suck up to this project...'
9267	-2.29411764706	A woefully dull, redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation, despite Iwai's vaunted empathy.
9268	-0.588235294118	Screenwriter Chris ver Weil's directing debut is good natured and never dull, but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability.
9269	-1.35294117647	If you really want to understand what this story is really all about, you're far better served by the source material.
9270	-2.17647058824	It's mildly sentimental, unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable.
9271	-1.6	Like its title character, Esther Kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating.
9272	-1.4	The star who helped give a spark to ''Chasing Amy'' and ''Changing Lanes'' falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer's new action film, ''The Sum of All Fears.''
9273	-2.6	A summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie, for that comes through all too painfully in the execution.
9274	-2.86666666667	Every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here.
9275	-2.86666666667	Snoots will no doubt rally to its cause, trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey, but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this.
9276	-1.93333333333	(The film's) taste for ''shock humor'' will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of Tom Green and the Farrelly Brothers.
9277	-1.26666666667	Any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things.
9278	-1.4	If legendary shlockmeister Ed Wood had ever made a movie about a vampire, it probably would look a lot like this alarming production, adapted from Anne Rice's novel The Vampire Chronicles.
9279	-0.333333333333	Hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown, the film nevertheless works up a few scares.
9280	-2.46666666667	Interminably bleak, to say nothing of boring.
9281	-2.13333333333	Things really get weird, though not particularly scary: the movie is all portent and no content.
9282	-1.13333333333	It's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post adolescent Electra rebellion.
9283	-2.2	Bogs down badly as we absorb Jia's moody, bad boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one note performance.
9284	-0.933333333333	The camera whirls! The camera twirls! Oh, look at that clever angle! Wow, a jump cut!
9285	-2.53333333333	Demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from Oscar winning master to lowly studio hack.
9286	-2.4	The action scenes have all the suspense of a 20 car pileup, while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through    if Kaos hadn't blown them all up.
9287	-1.66666666667	It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us.
9288	-0.466666666667	It puts Washington, as honest working man John Q. Archibald, on a pedestal, then keeps lifting the pedestal higher.
9289	-1.13333333333	Ultimately, the film amounts to being lectured to by tech geeks, if you're up for that sort of thing.
9290	1.73333333333	Far more enjoyable than its predecessor.
9291	-0.333333333333	(Gayton's script) telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience.
9292	-1.2	Full Frontal, which opens today nationwide, could almost be classified as a movie industry satire, but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive, if disingenuous, feature.
9293	-2.4	A ragbag of cliches.
9294	-2.73333333333	This rough trade Punch and Judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now.
9295	-1.53333333333	The three leads produce adequate performances, but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling.
9296	-1.6	It's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel, but the result is more puzzling than unsettling.
9297	-2.33333333333	This painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ... that have no bearing on the story.
9298	-0.466666666667	Short and sweet, but also more than anything else slight... Tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations.
9299	-0.466666666667	Has its moments, but it's pretty far from a treasure.
9300	-1.73333333333	What more can be expected from a college comedy that's target audience hasn't graduated from junior high school?
9301	1.0	Collateral Damage offers formula payback and the Big Payoff, but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks, pyro correctly.
9302	-2.06666666667	The plan to make Enough into `an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller' has flopped as surely as a soufflé gone wrong.
9303	-1.86666666667	Instead of letting the laughs come as they may, Lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny    er, comedy    like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank, take your pick.
9304	-2.93333333333	You know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket? Just send it to Cranky. We don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this.
9305	-1.8	An even more predictable, cliche ridden endeavor than its predecessor.
9306	-2.0	The whole thing plays like a tired Tyco ad.
9307	-1.73333333333	The film doesn't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non fan to figure out what makes Wilco a big deal.
9308	-1.4	The soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun, too.
9309	-2.2	No, I don't know why Steven Seagal is considered a star, nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money.
9310	-2.33333333333	Even by the intentionally low standards of frat boy humor, Sorority Boys is a bowser.
9311	-2.0	One well timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout, but a hundred of them can be numbing. Proof of this is Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever.
9312	-1.73333333333	Halfway through, however, having sucked dry the undead action flick formula, Blade II mutates into a gross out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary.
9313	-2.2	Weighted down with slow, uninvolving storytelling and flat acting.
9314	-2.86666666667	We can't accuse Kung Pow for misfiring, since it is exactly what it wants to be: an atrociously, mind numbingly, indescribably bad movie. Unfortunately, we'd prefer a simple misfire.
9315	-2.2	There isn't one moment in the film that surprises or delights.
9316	-0.4	'Wouldn't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it's like on the other side of the bra?'
9317	-0.466666666667	The movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments.
9318	-1.13333333333	Most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and, no matter how Broomfield dresses it up, it tends to speculation, conspiracy theories or, at best, circumstantial evidence.
9319	-1.73333333333	This movie, a certain scene in particular, brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch.
9320	-2.66666666667	The secrets of time travel will have been discovered, indulged in and rejected as boring before I see this piece of crap again.
9321	-2.8	Smug, artificial, ill constructed and fatally overlong...it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite, degenerating into a pious, preachy soap opera.
9322	-1.6	Chelsea Walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe.
9323	-2.53333333333	Every joke is repeated at least four times. Every joke is repeated at least four times. Every joke is repeated at least  annoying, isn't it?
9324	-1.4	Comes across as a fairly weak retooling.
9325	-1.73333333333	The lousy lead performances... keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired.
9326	-0.933333333333	Its and pieces of The Hot Chick are so hilarious, and Schneider's performance is so fine, it's a real shame that so much of the movie    again, as in The Animal    is a slapdash mess.
9327	-2.0	(Creates) the worst kind of mythologizing, the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama.
9328	-2.0	The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation, and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates.
9329	-0.666666666667	Earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding.
9330	-1.4	A sugar coated Rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks.
9331	-1.44444444444	Romanek keeps adding flourishes    artsy fantasy sequences    that simply feel wrong. They cheapen the overall effect.
9332	-1.38888888889	Has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of General Hospital.
9333	-1.27777777778	An acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8 10, but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to McDonald's, let alone some savvy street activism.
9334	-1.11111111111	(Allen's) been making piffle for a long while, and Hollywood Ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now.
9335	-2.61111111111	An exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound.
9336	-1.0	Not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans.
9337	-1.94444444444	The movie is silly beyond comprehension, and even if it weren't silly, it would still be beyond comprehension.
9338	-1.27777777778	Watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control    that is to say, when Carol Kane appears on the screen.
9339	-1.94444444444	The scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film's characters.
9340	-2.33333333333	Merchant hasn't directed this movie so much as produced it    like sausage.
9341	-1.55555555556	The film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes, and it's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is.
9342	-1.05555555556	More a gunfest than a Rock concert.
9343	-1.44444444444	It's a frightful vanity film that, no doubt, pays off what debt Miramax felt they owed to Benigni.
9344	-2.38888888889	A muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations. It makes me say the obvious: Abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here.
9345	-1.77777777778	It's not original enough.
9346	-1.44444444444	A listless sci fi comedy in which Eddie Murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect.
9347	-1.77777777778	Little more than a super sized infomercial for the cable sports channel and its Summer X Games.
9348	-2.33333333333	A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive.
9349	-2.16666666667	Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors, sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent.
9350	-2.66666666667	An unholy mess, driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy looking videotape, it must be labelled 'hip', 'innovative' and 'realistic'.
9351	-2.72222222222	The story's pathetic and the gags are puerile.
9352	-1.33333333333	. Curiously, Super Troopers suffers because it doesn't have enough vices to merit its 103 minute length.
9353	-2.61111111111	So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy.
9354	-2.72222222222	I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD. For free. I still want my money back.
9355	-2.0	It plods along methodically, somehow under the assumption that its ''dead wife communicating from beyond the grave'' framework is even remotely new or interesting.
9356	-1.5	It's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom, and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive.
9357	-1.66666666667	All too familiar...basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'Angels With Dirty Faces' appeared in 1938.
9358	-0.555555555556	...passable enough for a shoot out in the o.k. court house of life type of flick. Strictly middle of the road.
9359	-1.72222222222	Although purportedly a study in modern alienation, it's really little more than a particularly slanted, gay s/m fantasy, enervating and deadeningly drawn out.
9360	-1.77777777778	After the first 10 minutes, which is worth seeing, the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés, depression and bad alternative music.
9361	-1.3	No one can doubt the filmmakers' motives, but The Guys still feels counterproductive.
9362	-1.95	A very slow, uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel.
9363	-2.45	With little visible talent and no energy, Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee.
9364	-1.05	''Feardotcom'' has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel, but it simply becomes a routine shocker.
9365	-0.65	A Meatballs for the bare midriff generation.
9366	-0.3	Well meaning to a fault, Antwone Fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man's triumph of will into everyman's romance comedy.
9367	-1.35	Seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look, director Fisher Stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in Waking Life water colors.
9368	-1.7	Formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip.
9369	-2.25	Everything that was right about Blade is wrong in its sequel.
9370	-1.9	A few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film, but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100 minute running time, and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun.
9371	-2.8	The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher, and reflects the worst of their shallow styles: wildly overproduced, inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one (and no one).
9372	-1.85	Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick buck sequel.
9373	-2.35	Coarse, cliched and clunky, this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock.
9374	-2.85	Anyone who suffers through this film deserves, at the very least, a big box of consolation candy.
9375	-0.4	How much you are moved by the emotional tumult of (François and Michèle's) relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them.
9376	-1.45	They presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson, however entertainingly presented, so they trot out the conventional science fiction elements of bug eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes.
9377	-1.7	Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap happy series of adolescent violence.
9378	-2.55	The following things are not at all entertaining: The bad sound, the lack of climax and, worst of all, watching Seinfeld (who is also one of the film's producers) do everything he can to look like a good guy.
9379	-2.05	Attal's hang ups surrounding infidelity are so old fashioned and, dare I say, outdated, it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident.
9380	-3.2	Obvious, obnoxious and didactic burlesque.
9381	-3.15	The most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters.
9382	-2.65	Michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously.
9383	-2.0	Ultimately, clarity matters, both in breaking codes and making movies. Enigma lacks it.
9384	-1.5	Potty mouthed enough for PG 13, yet not as hilariously raunchy as South Park, this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults.
9385	-1.2	... has its moments, but ultimately, its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites.
9386	-1.15	A distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable, especially considering its barely feature length running time of one hour.
9387	-3.2	Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement.
9388	-1.5	In the end, Tuck Everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived: too much to do, too little time to do it in.
9389	-1.75	Rather less than the sum of its underventilated père fils confrontations.
9390	-2.15	McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about, or is ill equipped to examine, the interior lives of the characters in his film, much less incorporate them into his narrative.
9391	-1.0	Plays like a series of vignettes    clips of a film that are still looking for a common through line.
9392	0.0588235294118	New Yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell...
9393	-0.941176470588	Amid the shock and curiosity factors, the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way.
9394	-0.705882352941	Yes, Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination, but it's also a failure of storytelling.
9395	-1.94117647059	A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming of age movie.
9396	-1.64705882353	A somewhat disappointing and meandering saga.
9397	-2.11764705882	Whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie, we cut to a new scene, which also appears to be the end. But, no, we get another scene, and then another. You begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain.
9398	-3.0	An empty, ugly exercise in druggy trance noir and trumped up street credibility.
9399	-1.70588235294	The screenplay, co written by director Imogen Kimmel, lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise, making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing.
9400	-2.58823529412	The milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch.
9401	-2.29411764706	Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups, not much camera movement, and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters.
9402	-1.76470588235	Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea, but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting, while the third feels limited by its short running time.
9403	-1.52941176471	Except for Paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for Bartleby's pain, the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion.
9404	-1.0	Will no doubt delight Plympton's legion of fans; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting.
9405	-2.29411764706	The laughs are as rare as snake foo yung.
9406	-1.88235294118	For a film that celebrates radical, nonconformist values, What to Do in Case of Fire? lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional, reserved kind of filmmaking.
9407	-2.05882352941	Knockaround Guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be Quentin Tarantino when they grow up. But they lack their idol's energy and passion for detail.
9408	-1.82352941176	Mattei so completely loses himself to the film's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on, well, Love in the Time of Money.
9409	-1.41176470588	It briefly flirts with player masochism, but the point of real interest  – audience sadism    is evaded completely.
9410	0.117647058824	Holland lets things peter out midway, but it's notably better acted    and far less crass   than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals.
9411	-1.47058823529	For every articulate player, such as skateboarder Tony Hawk or BMX rider Mat Hoffman, are about a half dozen young Turks angling to see how many times they can work the words ''radical'' or ''suck'' into a sentence.
9412	-1.88235294118	There's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale.
9413	-3.0	An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo philosophic twaddle.
9414	-1.88235294118	It's unfortunate that Wallace, who wrote Gibson's Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor, has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue.
9415	0.647058823529	I liked the movie, but I know I would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further. I'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't.
9416	-1.76470588235	Dreary tale of middle class angst
9417	-1.88235294118	For a movie about the power of poetry and passion, there is precious little of either.
9418	-1.11764705882	(Jackson and Bledel) seem to have been picked not for their acting chops, but for their looks and appeal to the pre teen crowd.
9419	-1.23529411765	Lillard and Cardellini earn their Scooby Snacks, but not anyone else.
9420	-1.64705882353	Like Schindler's List, The Grey Zone attempts to be grandiloquent, but ends up merely pretentious    in a grisly sort of way.
9421	-3.25925925926	An unremittingly ugly movie to look at, listen to, and think about, it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the DV revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film.
9422	-1.85185185185	(Screenwriter) Pimental took the Farrelly Brothers comedy and feminized it, but it is a rather poor imitation.
9423	-2.44444444444	It's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey.
9424	-1.77777777778	Friday After Next is a lot more bluster than bite.
9425	-1.25925925926	Its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up.
9426	-0.37037037037	A decidedly mixed bag.
9427	-1.92592592593	There are cheesy backdrops, ridiculous action sequences, and many tired jokes about men in heels.
9428	-1.44444444444	Ice Cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas, but Friday After Next spreads them pretty thin.
9429	-1.07407407407	Not everything in the film works, including its somewhat convenient ending.
9430	-1.74074074074	The characters, cast in impossibly contrived situations, are totally estranged from reality.
9431	-1.85185185185	Everything else about High Crimes is, like the military system of justice it portrays, tiresomely regimented.
9432	-2.92592592593	Just dreadful. I don't blame Eddie Murphy but shouldn't Owen Wilson know a movie must have a story and a script?
9433	-2.07407407407	Sweet Home Alabama certainly won't be remembered as one of (Witherspoon's) better films.
9434	-1.51851851852	hard as this may be to believe, Here on Earth, a surprisingly similar teen drama, was a better film.
9435	-2.40740740741	This is just lazy writing. Even kids deserve better.
9436	-2.48148148148	The pretensions    and disposable story    sink the movie. And Diesel isn't the actor to save it.
9437	-1.77777777778	Bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of Castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda.
9438	-1.2962962963	... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of John Woo bullet ballet.
9439	-1.88888888889	Frank Capra played this story straight. But the 2002 film doesn't really believe in it, and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate 'comedy' scenes.
9440	-2.62962962963	How about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross out gags on top of the same old crap?
9441	-2.55555555556	The problem is that for the most part, the film is deadly dull.
9442	-2.33333333333	Handled correctly, Wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice. Here, alas, it collapses like an overcooked soufflé.
9443	-2.59259259259	''Sorority Boys'' was funnier, and that movie was pretty bad.
9444	-2.2962962963	A bizarre piece of work, with premise and dialogue at the level of kids' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy, rape and suspected murder
9445	-1.37037037037	Paul Bettany is good at being the ultra violent gangster wannabe, but the movie is certainly not number 1.
9446	-0.444444444444	It's a gag that's worn a bit thin over the years, though Don't Ask still finds a few chuckles.
9447	-0.37037037037	An uplifting drama ... What Antwone Fisher isn't, however, is original.
9448	-0.851851851852	Often likable, but just as often it's meandering, low on energy, and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old fashioned storytelling would come in handy.
9449	-2.7037037037	Certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike, Eight Crazy Nights is a total misfire.
9450	-1.2962962963	Elaborate special effects take centre screen, so that the human story is pushed to one side.
9451	-0.947368421053	Showtime isn't particularly assaultive, but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase, explosion or gunfight again.
9452	-1.15789473684	All the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams.
9453	-2.05263157895	This Tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations.
9454	-1.52631578947	I have no problem with ''difficult'' movies, or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out. But first, you have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort
9455	-1.89473684211	Been there, done that... a thousand times already, and better.
9456	-1.68421052632	What's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast, but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism.
9457	-1.84210526316	Sunk by way too much indulgence of scene chewing, teeth gnashing actorliness.
9458	-0.947368421053	Fans of Plympton's shorts may marginally enjoy the film, but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers.
9459	-1.0	Barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality.
9460	-1.73684210526	None of this sounds promising and, indeed, the first half of Sorority Boys is as appalling as any 'comedy' to ever spill from a projector's lens.
9461	-1.31578947368	The kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics.
9462	-2.0	'Punch Drunk Love is so convinced of its own brilliance that, if it were a person, you'd want to smash its face in.'
9463	-1.15789473684	At once overly old fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance.
9464	-2.05263157895	The trashy teen sleaze equivalent of Showgirls.
9465	-0.789473684211	While the production details are lavish, film has little insight into the historical period and its artists, particularly in how Sand developed a notorious reputation.
9466	-2.31578947368	A crass and insulting homage to great films like Some Like It Hot and the John Wayne classics.
9467	-1.73684210526	What's the most positive thing that can be said about the new Rob Schneider vehicle? Well, it's not as pathetic as The Animal.
9468	-1.15789473684	With all the sympathy, empathy and pity fogging up the screen...His Secret Life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles.
9469	-1.10526315789	The problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up Shum's good intentions.
9470	-1.63157894737	What 'Blade Runner' would've looked like as a low budget series on a UHF channel.
9471	-1.31578947368	Has all the values of a straight to video movie, but because it has a bigger name cast, it gets a full theatrical release.
9472	-1.89473684211	With its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action, All About the Benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s.
9473	0.368421052632	It never quite makes it to the boiling point, but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time.
9474	-2.94736842105	Loud, silly, stupid and pointless.
9475	-1.31578947368	Mandel Holland's direction is uninspired, and his scripting unsurprising, but the performances by Phifer and Black are ultimately winning. You'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie.
9476	-1.42105263158	A yawn provoking little farm melodrama.
9477	-2.36842105263	Did no one on the set have a sense of humor, or did they not have the nerve to speak up?
9478	-1.78947368421	Seriously, rent the Disney version.
9479	-1.47368421053	As David Letterman and The Onion have proven, the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor, but Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them.
9480	-0.210526315789	Like its parade of predecessors, this Halloween is a gory slash fest. It can't escape its past, and it doesn't want to.
9481	-3.13333333333	''Abandon'' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater.
9482	-2.13333333333	Problem is, we have no idea what in creation is going on.
9483	-0.8	A live action cartoon, a fast moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind.
9484	-1.93333333333	A loquacious and dreary piece of business.
9485	-2.4	What the audience feels is exhaustion, from watching a movie that is dark (dark green, to be exact), sour, bloody and mean.
9486	-2.6	director Hoffman, his writer and Kline's agent should serve detention
9487	-0.933333333333	Dodgy mixture of cutesy romance, dark satire and murder mystery.
9488	0.0666666666667	Meticulously mounted, exasperatingly well behaved film, which ticks off Kahlo's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant.
9489	-0.933333333333	Time of Favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation.
9490	-2.73333333333	I'm not sure which will take longer to heal: the welt on Johnny Knoxville's stomach from a riot control projectile or my own tortured psyche.
9491	-1.13333333333	While Serving Sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest Austin Powers extravaganza, there's nothing here to match that movie's intermittent moments of inspiration.
9492	-2.86666666667	I'm not sure which is worse: the poor acting by the ensemble cast, the flat dialogue by Vincent R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice Guillen.
9493	-3.26666666667	The only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow.
9494	-2.0	Whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards, someone should dispense the same advice to film directors.
9495	-1.8	As with so many merchandised to the max movies of this type, more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script, which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else.
9496	-2.66666666667	The Irwins' scenes are fascinating; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death defying efforts.
9497	-2.93333333333	If routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea, then pay your $8 and get ready for the big shear. This is one baaaaaaaaad movie.
9498	-3.26666666667	A man leaving the screening said the film was better than Saving Private Ryan. He may have meant the Internet short Saving Ryan's Privates. But Windtalkers doesn't beat that one, either.
9499	-1.06666666667	May puzzle his most ardent fans.
9500	-2.13333333333	Starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill.
9501	-1.4	We never feel anything for these characters, and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity.
9502	-0.8	Those unfamiliar with Mormon traditions may find The Singles Ward occasionally bewildering.
9503	-0.466666666667	Ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head, but he knows how to pose Madonna.
9504	-1.6	The story, touching though it is, does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature, and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long.
9505	-1.6	Feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired    of fighting the same fights, of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders, of playing with narrative form.
9506	-1.73333333333	While you have to admit it's semi amusing to watch Robert DeNiro belt out ''When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way,'' it's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to ''Tonight.''
9507	-2.8	The whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it's trying to set the women's liberation movement back 20 years.
9508	-0.666666666667	'...the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well...but quite frankly, Scoob and Shag don't eat enough during the film.'
9509	-2.66666666667	More of the same old garbage Hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now.
9510	-1.8	TV skit com material fervently deposited on the big screen.
9511	0.733333333333	(Johnnie To and Wai Ka Fai are) sure to find an enthusiastic audience among American action adventure buffs, but the film's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers.
9512	-1.53333333333	If there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout, this is the one.
9513	-2.26666666667	It's as sorry a mess as its director's diabolical debut, Mad Cows.
9514	-1.13333333333	Any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director Jon Purdy's sledgehammer sap.
9515	-2.0	Its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity, Steven Soderbergh's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience.
9516	-1.06666666667	Despite some strong performances, never rises above the level of a telanovela.
9517	-0.333333333333	This is a picture that Maik, the firebrand turned savvy ad man, would be envious of: it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool.
9518	0.133333333333	Feels slight, as if it were an extended short, albeit one made by the smartest kids in class.
9519	-2.06666666667	Unspeakable, of course, barely begins to describe the plot and its complications. Vulgar is too optimistic a title.
9520	-0.533333333333	The actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene, but to diminishing effect. The characters never change.
9521	-2.2	If The Last Man were the last movie left on earth, there would be a toss up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows.
9522	0.6	Welles groupie/scholar Peter Bogdanovich took a long time to do it, but he's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant William Randolph Hearst.
9523	-1.53333333333	Makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes, becoming so slick and watered down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place.
9524	-1.8	Even as I valiantly struggled to remain interested, or at least conscious, I could feel my eyelids ... getting ... very ... heavy ...
9525	-1.33333333333	A bad movie that happened to good actors.
9526	-0.466666666667	Boasts eye catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome.
9527	-0.8	Screenwriter Dan Schneider and director Shawn Levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite.
9528	-1.33333333333	Oversexed, at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty, female and single.
9529	-2.6	That such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year's worst cinematic tragedies.
9530	-1.06666666667	It all starts to smack of a Hallmark Hall of Fame, with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television.
9531	-1.2	Rarely has a film's title served such dire warning.
9532	-2.53333333333	If you saw Benigni's Pinocchio at a public park, you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police.
9533	-0.6	The animation is competent, and some of the gags are quite funny, but Jonah ... never shakes the oppressive, morally superior good for you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment.
9534	-1.2	The pace of the film is very slow (for obvious reasons) and that too becomes off putting.
9535	-0.533333333333	Mr. Wollter and Ms. Seldhal give strong and convincing performances, but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion, grief and fear.
9536	-1.06666666667	Shafer's feature doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting.
9537	-0.866666666667	In his role of observer of the scene, Lawrence sounds whiny and defensive, as if his life altering experiences made him bitter and less mature.
9538	-0.866666666667	(T)he ideas of Revolution #9 are more compelling than the execution
9539	-0.866666666667	The film didn't convince me that Calvin Jr.'s Barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of Chicago's South Side.
9540	-1.0	What happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares?
9541	-0.944444444444	Despite some comic sparks, Welcome to Collinwood never catches fire.
9542	-2.05555555556	Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries, but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad, and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place.
9543	-1.44444444444	Shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling.
9544	-1.44444444444	Even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency.
9545	-0.5	Some Body is a shaky, uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves.
9546	-1.44444444444	All the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition.
9547	-2.05555555556	(A) stale retread of the '53 original.
9548	-1.83333333333	One thing's for sure  if George Romero had directed this movie, it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head.
9549	-0.777777777778	For dance completists only.
9550	-1.44444444444	Spreads itself too thin, leaving these actors, as well as the members of the commune, short of profound characterizations
9551	-2.72222222222	It wouldn't matter so much that this arrogant Richard Pryor wannabe's routine is offensive, puerile and unimaginatively foul mouthed if it was at least funny.
9552	-1.5	The locale ... remains far more interesting than the story at hand.
9553	-1.05555555556	Yo, it's The Days Of Our Lives meets Electric Boogaloo.
9554	-1.83333333333	I liked the original short story but this movie, even at an hour and twenty some minutes, it's too long and it goes nowhere.
9555	-3.0	This little film is so slovenly done, so primitive in technique, that it can't really be called animation.
9556	-3.0	Makes 98 minutes feel like three hours.
9557	-3.27777777778	Hawke's film, a boring, pretentious waste of nearly two hours, doesn't tell you anything except that the Chelsea Hotel today is populated by whiny, pathetic, starving and untalented artistes.
9558	-2.27777777778	Aspires to the cracked lunacy of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai, but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like The Adventures of Ford Fairlane.
9559	-1.55555555556	Real life strongman Ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders.
9560	-2.94444444444	The title, alone, should scare any sane person away.
9561	-3.11111111111	Low comedy doesn't come much lower.
9562	-1.72222222222	Appropriately cynical social commentary aside, #9 never quite ignites.
9563	-2.88888888889	It's crap on a leash  far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of Joe Dante's similarly styled Gremlins.
9564	-3.33333333333	One of the most depressing movie going experiences I can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so called 'comedy' and not laugh once.
9565	-2.11111111111	This is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream.
9566	-2.22222222222	Let's face it    there aren't many reasons anyone would want to see Crossroads if they're not big fans of teen pop kitten Britney Spears.
9567	-2.33333333333	A loud, brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy.
9568	-2.27777777778	An exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work, every bit as imperious as Katzenberg's The Prince of Egypt from 1998.
9569	-2.61111111111	The movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue, just because it seems obligatory.
9570	-1.61111111111	The movie's vision of a white American zealously spreading a Puritanical brand of Christianity to South Seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish.
9571	-1.85	Maid in Manhattan proves that it's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies.
9572	-1.3	A fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature length afterschool special.
9573	-2.25	I can't remember the last time I saw a movie where I wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail.
9574	-2.0	...the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy.
9575	-1.3	Like most of Jaglom's films, some of it is honestly affecting, but more of it seems contrived and secondhand.
9576	-1.8	One long, numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff Yuen has given us before.
9577	-0.65	Forgettable, if good hearted, movie.
9578	-2.25	The film's most improbable feat? It didn't go straight to video.
9579	-2.55	...about as exciting to watch as two last place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season.
9580	-1.25	The Chateau... is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters.
9581	-3.25	Cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment... simultaneously degrades its characters, its stars and its audience.
9582	-1.25	It's not too fast and not too slow. It's not too racy and it's not too offensive. It's not too much of anything.
9583	-2.4	The great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses – and ours – and retitle it The Adventures of Direct to Video Nash, and send it to its proper home.
9584	-1.95	About as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life.
9585	-1.95	An empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal.
9586	-1.6	We could have expected a little more human being, and a little less product.
9587	-1.5	Instead of using George and Lucy's most obvious differences to ignite sparks, Lawrence desperately looks elsewhere, seizing on George's haplessness and Lucy's personality tics.
9588	-0.65	Whether Quitting will prove absorbing to American audiences is debatable.
9589	-1.45	Becomes a bit of a mishmash: a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't.
9590	-1.75	Family togetherness takes a back seat to inter family rivalry and workplace ambition... whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance.
9591	-1.45	Grant isn't Cary and Bullock isn't Katherine.
9592	-1.75	Like a fish that's lived too long, Austin Powers in Goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places.
9593	-0.65	Two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending.
9594	-1.75	Shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom.
9595	-2.2	The entire movie is in need of a scented bath.
9596	-2.2	I'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal   Arnold is not, nor will he be, back.
9597	-2.05	The story of Trouble Every Day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science fiction horror film, and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult.
9598	-2.3	A Movie to Forget
9599	-1.8	For all of its insights into the dream world of teen life, and its electronic expression through cyber culture, the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2 hour running time.
9600	-1.1	Enough is not a bad movie, just mediocre. The performances are so overstated, the effect comes off as self parody.
9601	-1.11764705882	It looks good, but it is essentially empty.
9602	-1.76470588235	The film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long.
9603	-2.17647058824	The idea is more interesting than the screenplay, which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not very funny comedy, unconvincing dramatics and some last minute action strongly reminiscent of Run Lola Run.
9604	-1.82352941176	Van Wilder has a built in audience, but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest.
9605	-2.11764705882	It's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby.
9606	-1.82352941176	Do we really need another film that praises female self sacrifice?
9607	-1.52941176471	The major problem with Windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character.
9608	-0.941176470588	Tennessee Williams by way of Oprah's Book Club.
9609	-2.41176470588	So verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made for TV movie.
9610	-1.88235294118	The entire point of a shaggy dog story, of course, is that it goes nowhere, and this is classic nowheresville in every sense.
9611	-2.70588235294	Stale and clichéd to a fault.
9612	-1.52941176471	This film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own.
9613	-2.47058823529	Watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt, as if you were paying dues for good books unread, fine music never heard.
9614	-1.70588235294	The script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of 'hypertime' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for Spy Kids.
9615	-1.0	Starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it    but filmmaker Yvan Attal quickly writes himself into a corner.
9616	-1.47058823529	Some Like It Hot on the Hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny.
9617	-1.76470588235	Unfortunately, contrived plotting, stereotyped characters and Woo's over the top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie's heart.
9618	-3.29411764706	Witless and utterly pointless.
9619	-2.29411764706	When 'science fiction' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience hasn't yet had much science, it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre.
9620	-0.764705882353	Show me the mugging.
9621	-1.47058823529	Represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre.
9622	-0.764705882353	Visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying.
9623	-2.17647058824	As a feature length film, it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character.
9624	-1.70588235294	A guilty pleasure at best, and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it.
9625	-2.70588235294	A sleep inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away.
9626	-2.70588235294	With a ''Spy Kids'' sequel opening next week, why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a ''SNL'' has been acting like an 8 year old channeling Roberto Benigni?
9627	-2.47058823529	It's just rather leaden and dull.
9628	-2.41176470588	Lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago.
9629	-1.29411764706	Statham employs an accent that I think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass American but sometimes just lapses into unhidden British.
9630	-2.47058823529	Instead of trying to bust some blondes, (Diggs) should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad.
9631	0.277777777778	Initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience.
9632	-1.22222222222	De Ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is, overall, far too staid for its subject matter.
9633	-2.44444444444	Dismally dull sci fi comedy.
9634	-2.27777777778	There's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits.
9635	-0.222222222222	When one hears Harry Shearer is going to make his debut as a film director, one would hope for the best
9636	-1.44444444444	The leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting.
9637	-1.61111111111	(Toback's) fondness for fancy split screen, stuttering editing and pompous references to Wittgenstein and Kirkegaard ... blends uneasily with the titillating material.
9638	-2.33333333333	Adam Sandler's 8 Crazy Nights is 75 wasted minutes of Sandler as the voice over hero in Columbia Pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie.
9639	-1.94444444444	essentially ''Fatal Attraction'' remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987. ...this story gets sillier, not scarier, as it goes along...
9640	-2.77777777778	Even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of Job to get through this interminable, shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture.
9641	-2.61111111111	The film's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence.
9642	-1.72222222222	A singularly off putting romantic comedy.
9643	-1.16666666667	This is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship.
9644	-1.94444444444	It all comes down to whether you can tolerate Leon Barlow. I can't.
9645	-1.66666666667	In the spirit of the season, I assign one bright shining star to Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio    but I guarantee that no wise men will be following after it.
9646	-0.722222222222	Check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you don't want to think too much about what's going on. The movie does has some entertainment value   how much depends on how well you like Chris Rock.
9647	-1.33333333333	A movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting than by its own story.
9648	-1.61111111111	A culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is.
9649	-1.88888888889	The logic of it all will be Greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor.
9650	-1.0	As self aware movies go, Who is Cletis Tout? is clever enough, though thin writing proves its undoing.
9651	-1.66666666667	Starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus, point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages, over blown drama and Bruce Willis with a scar.
9652	-1.83333333333	... a fascinating curiosity piece    fascinating, that is, for about ten minutes. After that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course.
9653	-1.55555555556	Director Jay Russell weighs down his capricious fairy tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning.
9654	-1.44444444444	There are many things that solid acting can do for a movie, but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them.
9655	-2.22222222222	Its screenplay serves as auto critique, and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure.
9656	-3.0	At times, it actually hurts to watch.
9657	-2.33333333333	Nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection, several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme.
9658	-2.55555555556	The jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail.
9659	-2.27777777778	(Tries) to parody a genre that's already a joke in the United States. The movie is the equivalent of French hip hop, which also seems to play on a 10 year delay.
9660	-3.0	A beyond lame satire, Teddy Bears' Picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer actor.
9661	-3.6	I've never seen (a remake) do anything as stomach turning as the way Adam Sandler's new movie rapes, pillages and incinerates Frank Capra's classic...
9662	-1.73333333333	Hollywood's answer to an air ball.
9663	-1.06666666667	And people make fun of me for liking Showgirls.
9664	-1.93333333333	Such a wildly uneven hit and miss enterprise, you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day to day basis during production.
9665	-0.8	A weird little movie that's amusing enough while you watch it, offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern L.A.'s show biz and media subcultures. But it doesn't leave you with much.
9666	-2.33333333333	I'm convinced I could keep a family of five blind, crippled, Amish people alive in this situation better than these British soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking.
9667	-1.8	Like Mike is a slight and uninventive movie: Like the exalted Michael Jordan referred to in the title, many can aspire but none can equal.
9668	-2.93333333333	There is nothing funny in this every joke has  been told a  thousand times  before movie.
9669	-0.8	Always destined to be measured against Anthony Asquith's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation.
9670	-2.2	This is standard crime drama fare... instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull.
9671	-1.73333333333	There's some outrageously creative action in The Transporter ... (b)ut by the time Frank parachutes down onto a moving truck, it's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman.
9672	-1.46666666667	One of those based on truth stories that persuades you, with every scene, that it could never really have happened this way.
9673	-2.0	From its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast, Bartleby squanders as much as it gives out.
9674	-2.06666666667	Yet another genre exercise, Gangster No. 1 is as generic as its title.
9675	0.0	Despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot, moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair...
9676	-1.46666666667	There's an admirable rigor to Jimmy's relentless anger, and to the script's refusal of a happy ending, but as those monologues stretch on and on, you realize there's no place for this story to go but down.
9677	-2.2	Once again, the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated, and a meaty plot and well developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle.
9678	-0.866666666667	A lightweight, uneven action comedy that freely mingles French, Japanese and Hollywood cultures.
9679	-2.53333333333	Such a fine idea for a film, and such a stultifying, lifeless execution.
9680	-0.0666666666667	(Allen's) best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle America diversions could ever be.
9681	-2.66666666667	This overlong infomercial, due out on video before month's end, is tepid and tedious.
9682	-1.93333333333	An ambitious, guilt suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting.
9683	-2.8	Rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti erotic.
9684	-2.86666666667	A dull, inconsistent, dishonest female bonding picture.
9685	-2.53333333333	So much about the film is loopy and ludicrous ... that it could have been a hoot in a bad movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened.
9686	-1.8	A disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate IMAX trip.
9687	-1.6	Does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of Richard Nixon.
9688	-2.26666666667	This Sade is hardly a perverse, dangerous libertine and agitator    which would have made for better drama. He's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery, and the film seems as deflated as he does.
9689	-1.53333333333	The film's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe eyed Crudup out of pre 9/11 New York and onto a cross country road trip of the Homeric kind.
9690	-2.33333333333	It's as if a bored Cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream: ''Got AIDS yet?''
9691	-0.473684210526	In a strange way, Egoyan has done too much. He's worked too hard on this movie.
9692	-2.26315789474	The film has the thrown together feel of a summer camp talent show: hastily written, underrehearsed, arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo.
9693	-1.47368421053	The last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others' affections.
9694	-0.894736842105	A clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary, naturalistic tone of the film ...
9695	-1.26315789474	The movie's messages are quite admirable, but the story is just too clichéd and too often strains credulity.
9696	-1.52631578947	What we have here isn't a disaster, exactly, but a very handsomely produced let down.
9697	-1.94736842105	The script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times    either 11 times too many or else too few.
9698	-2.05263157895	A shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns, expensive cars, lots of naked women and Rocawear clothing.
9699	-1.52631578947	To the filmmakers, Ivan is a prince of a fellow, but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean spirited, and there's no indication that he's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit.
9700	-2.63157894737	This is a movie filled with unlikable, spiteful idiots; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least.
9701	-1.57894736842	It's as if Allen, at 66, has stopped challenging himself.
9702	-1.21052631579	Scotland, PA is entirely too straight faced to transcend its clever concept.
9703	-2.0	A movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between Highlander and Lolita.
9704	-2.0	Not only does LeBlanc make one spectacularly ugly looking broad, but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes.
9705	-2.31578947368	There's little to recommend Snow Dogs, unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity.
9706	-2.05263157895	It's deep sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in There's Something About Mary and devise a parallel clone gag.
9707	-2.05263157895	The film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes    it's insanely violent and very graphic.
9708	-2.89473684211	Sorority Boys, which is as bad at it is cruel, takes every potential laugh and stiletto stomps the life out of it.
9709	-2.31578947368	Here the love scenes all end in someone screaming. Maybe there's a metaphor here, but figuring it out wouldn't make Trouble Every Day any better.
9710	-2.26315789474	This is the first film I've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved.
9711	-1.42105263158	Fans of so bad they're good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess.
9712	-1.47368421053	Weiss and Speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th century footnotes.
9713	-2.84210526316	Sheridan is painfully bad, a fourth rate Jim Carrey who doesn't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb.
9714	-1.26315789474	Presents nothing special and, until the final act, nothing overtly disagreeable.
9715	-3.63157894737	The most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill.
9716	-2.05263157895	Was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz?
9717	-2.10526315789	It goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots.
9718	-1.78947368421	It's absolutely amazing how first time director Kevin Donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of Chan. Make Chan's action sequences boring.
9719	-1.31578947368	You ... get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone.
9720	-2.10526315789	'In this poor remake of such a well loved classic, Parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision.'
9721	-2.52941176471	It's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn.
9722	-1.94117647059	The film's final hour, where nearly all the previous unseen material resides, is unconvincing soap opera that Tornatore was right to cut.
9723	-1.70588235294	The movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating.
9724	-2.23529411765	I found it slow, predictable and not very amusing.
9725	-2.0	Director Yu seems far more interested in gross out humor than in showing us well thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10,000 times.
9726	-2.35294117647	Viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who's who in this pretentious mess.
9727	-0.882352941176	A pint sized 'Goodfellas' designed to appeal to the younger set, it's not a very good movie in any objective sense, but it does mostly hold one's interest.
9728	-2.41176470588	Get out your pooper scoopers.
9729	0.941176470588	While the material is slight, the movie is better than you might think.
9730	-1.94117647059	It's definitely not made for kids or their parents, for that matter, and I think even fans of Sandler's comic taste may find it uninteresting.
9731	-1.94117647059	Sheridan seems terrified of the book's irreverent energy, and scotches most of its élan, humor, bile, and irony.
9732	-2.05882352941	More busy than exciting, more frantic than involving, more chaotic than entertaining.
9733	-1.23529411765	There are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film. It's makes a better travelogue than movie.
9734	-2.11764705882	It's as if Solondz had two ideas for two movies, couldn't really figure out how to flesh either out, so he just slopped `em together here.
9735	-1.70588235294	The fourth in a series that I'll bet most parents had thought   hoped!    was a fad that had long since vanished.
9736	-1.70588235294	It's a long way from Orwell's dark, intelligent warning cry (1984) to the empty stud knockabout of Equilibrium, and what once was conviction is now affectation.
9737	-1.47058823529	Its premise is smart, but the execution is pretty weary.
9738	-2.11764705882	The holiday message of the 37 minute Santa vs. the Snowman leaves a lot to be desired.
9739	-0.294117647059	more precious than perspicacious
9740	-1.88235294118	If you saw it on TV, you'd probably turn it off, convinced that you had already seen that movie.
9741	-1.94117647059	(T)he script isn't up to the level of the direction, nor are the uneven performances by the cast members, who seem bound and determined to duplicate Bela Lugosi's now cliched vampire accent.
9742	-1.35294117647	If this is cinema, I pledge allegiance to Cagney and Lacey.
9743	-0.941176470588	Enigma looks great, has solid acting and a neat premise. Yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.
9744	-1.88235294118	Most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes.
9745	-2.05882352941	Starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary, humorless soap opera.
9746	0.647058823529	While there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the Elizabethans (as well as rank frustration from those in the know about Rubbo's dumbed down tactics), Much Ado About Something is an amicable endeavor.
9747	-1.0	It's actually too sincere    the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick.
9748	-1.64705882353	Most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly    like between lunch breaks for Shearer's radio show and his Simpson voice overs.
9749	-0.882352941176	Perry's good and his is an interesting character, but ''Serving Sara'' hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff. Nor is it a romantic comedy.
9750	-0.705882352941	Culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti Harry Potter    right down to the Gryffindor scarf.
9751	-1.25	Memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and, by extension, its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual.
9752	-0.7	It's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good.
9753	-2.35	In the not too distant future, movies like Ghost Ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds. Right now, they're merely signposts marking the slow, lingering death of imagination.
9754	-1.5	The movie's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette Juliette Lewis playing a salt of the earth mommy named Minnie and watching Slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable Halloween costume shop would ever try to sell.
9755	-0.95	Like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior ... Circuit gets drawn into the party.
9756	-2.1	It appears as if even the filmmakers didn't know what kind of movie they were making.
9757	-2.15	Beneath the uncanny, inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie biz farce...lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments.
9758	-1.4	Snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good.
9759	-0.6	Piccoli's performance is amazing, yes, but the symbols of loss and denial and life at arm's length in the film seem irritatingly transparent.
9760	-3.0	Starts out mediocre, spirals downward, and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion.
9761	-1.7	Nicolas Cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray, and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career.
9762	-1.15	It lacks the compassion, good natured humor and the level of insight that made (Eyre's) first film something of a sleeper success.
9763	-0.55	The result is good gossip, entertainingly delivered, yet with a distinctly musty odour, its expiry date long gone.
9764	-1.4	A sustained fest of self congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer.
9765	-1.0	All Analyze That proves is that there is really only one movie's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise.
9766	-2.05	Green ruins every single scene he's in, and the film, while it's not completely wreaked, is seriously compromised by that.
9767	-2.5	There's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy.
9768	-1.85	The story is predictable, the jokes are typical Sandler fare, and the romance with Ryder is puzzling.
9769	-2.05	Wallace directs with such patronising reverence, it turns the stomach.
9770	-2.7	Resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad Blair Witch Project.
9771	-2.45	Poor Ben Bratt couldn't find stardom if MapQuest emailed him point to point driving directions.
9772	-2.4	Pretend like your SAT scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws.
9773	-2.15	Unlike Trey Parker, Sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny, not actually exploiting it yourself.
9774	-1.8	A fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them.
9775	-2.5	An empty, purposeless exercise.
9776	-1.0	Earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock.
9777	-2.7	Haneke's script (from Elfriede Jelinek's novel) is contrived, unmotivated, and psychologically unpersuasive, with an inconclusive ending.
9778	-0.75	A sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama.
9779	-1.4	Those 24 and unders looking for their own Caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking.
9780	-0.7	A distinctly mixed bag, the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze.
9781	-1.44444444444	What begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes.
9782	-0.925925925926	Ultimately, Jane learns her place as a girl, softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with.
9783	-1.81481481481	Ah nuld's action hero days might be over.
9784	-2.14814814815	It's clear why Deuces Wild, which was shot two years ago, has been gathering dust on MGM's shelf.
9785	-2.25925925926	Feels like nothing quite so much as a middle aged moviemaker's attempt to surround himself with beautiful, half naked women.
9786	-1.55555555556	When the precise nature of Matthew's predicament finally comes into sharp focus, the revelation fails to justify the build up.
9787	-1.81481481481	This picture is murder by numbers, and as easy to be bored by as your ABC's, despite a few whopping shootouts.
9788	0.62962962963	Hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud.
9789	0.888888888889	If you are into splatter movies, then you will probably have a reasonably good time with The Salton Sea.
9790	-2.22222222222	A dull, simple minded and stereotypical tale of drugs, death and mind numbing indifference on the inner city streets.
9791	-1.40740740741	The feature length stretch ... strains the show's concept.
9792	-1.88888888889	This slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80 minute running time.
9793	-0.481481481481	A film that will probably please people already fascinated by Behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration.
9794	-1.14814814815	Davis the performer is plenty fetching enough, but she needs to shake up the mix, and work in something that doesn't feel like a half baked stand up routine.
9795	-1.55555555556	The densest distillation of Roberts' movies ever made.
9796	-2.03703703704	Ultimately, the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly American abroad, and the too frosty exterior Ms. Paltrow employs to authenticate her British persona is another liability.
9797	-1.22222222222	A handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on PBS than a night out at an AMC.
9798	-2.74074074074	Tom Green and an Ivy League college should never appear together on a marquee, especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like Stealing Harvard, which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800.
9799	-0.851851851852	(It) highlights not so much the crime lord's messianic bent, but Spacey's.
9800	-2.51851851852	Master of Disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours.
9801	-1.59259259259	A reworking of Die Hard and Cliffhanger but it's nowhere near as exciting as either.
9802	-1.88888888889	Suffers from unlikable characters and a self conscious sense of its own quirky hipness.
9803	-0.888888888889	A film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity.
9804	-0.777777777778	Fessenden continues to do interesting work, and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget. But the problem with Wendigo, for all its effective moments, isn't really one of resources.
9805	0.0740740740741	Spirit is a visual treat, and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards, but it lacks a strong narrative.
9806	-1.81481481481	It stars schticky Chris Rock and stolid Anthony Hopkins, who seem barely in the same movie. Their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic    it's just a weird fizzle.
9807	0.481481481481	This is a children's film in the truest sense. It's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message, so it's great for the kids. Parents, on the other hand, will be ahead of the plot at all times, and there isn't enough clever innuendo to fil
9808	-0.185185185185	The niftiest trick perpetrated by The Importance of Being Earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of Wilde into Austen  and a Hollywood ized Austen at that.
9809	-2.14814814815	Tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with Kieslowski's lyrical pessimism; it completely contradicts everything Kieslowski's work aspired to, including the condition of art.
9810	0.0	Ice Age is the first computer generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies, and that makes for some glacial pacing early on.
9811	-1.26666666667	Too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility.
9812	-2.66666666667	Cherry Orchard is badly edited, often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a 'back story.'
9813	-2.0	What ensues are much blood splattering, mass drug induced bowel evacuations, and none too funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between Americans and Brits.
9814	-1.73333333333	A dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so. The movie is without intent.
9815	-0.4	Visually exciting sci fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay.
9816	-0.733333333333	While Hollywood Ending has its share of belly laughs (including a knockout of a closing line), the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity.
9817	-1.46666666667	If The Full Monty was a freshman fluke, Lucky Break is (Cattaneo) sophomore slump.
9818	-1.2	Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant make a great team, but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip.
9819	-1.33333333333	Allegiance to Chekhov, which director Michael Cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of The Cherry Orchard, is a particularly vexing handicap.
9820	-1.93333333333	You expect more from director Michael Apted (Enigma) and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan (Reversal of Fortune) than this cliche pileup.
9821	-1.66666666667	The first mistake, I suspect, is casting Shatner as a legendary professor and Kunis as a brilliant college student  where's Pauly Shore as the rocket scientist?
9822	-2.0	The dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny, and the action sequences    clearly the main event    are surprisingly uninvolving.
9823	-2.4	Replacing John Carpenter's stylish tracking shots is degraded, handheld Blair Witch video cam footage. Of all the Halloween's, this is the most visually unappealing.
9824	-1.0	It has the requisite faux urban vibe and hotter two years ago rap and R&amp;B names and references.
9825	-1.73333333333	Despite its dry wit and compassion, the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing.
9826	-1.93333333333	...feels as if (there's) a choke leash around your neck so director Nick Cassavetes can give it a good, hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something.
9827	-1.86666666667	Attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama. He seems to want both, but succeeds in making neither.
9828	-2.46666666667	I could have used my two hours better watching Being John Malkovich again.
9829	-1.13333333333	It's not a bad plot; but, unfortunately, the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from.
9830	-1.4	Girlfriends are bad, wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter Italian comedy.
9831	-2.46666666667	The only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants... who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds.
9832	-1.13333333333	The film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances, but the result is disappointing.
9833	-1.73333333333	No Such Thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina.
9834	-1.8	Unfortunately, neither Sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate.
9835	-2.0	A wishy washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung, but explains its characters' decisions only unsatisfactorily.
9836	-0.866666666667	Bang! Zoom! It's actually pretty funny, but in all the wrong places.
9837	-1.53333333333	Lurid and less than lucid work.
9838	-1.2	A wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep school kid with a Mrs. Robinson complex founders on its own preciousness    and squanders its beautiful women.
9839	-1.53333333333	At a brief 42 minutes, we need more X and less blab.
9840	0.133333333333	If anything, see it for Karen Black, who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named Dirty Dick.
9841	-2.0	This 90 minute dud could pass for Mike Tyson's E! True Hollywood Story.
9842	-2.94736842105	This is surely one of the most frantic, virulent and foul natured Christmas season pics ever delivered by a Hollywood studio.
9843	-2.47368421053	Once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand, even the funniest idea isn't funny.
9844	-2.31578947368	A porn film without the sex scenes.
9845	-1.21052631579	The connected stories of Breitbart and Hanussen are actually fascinating, but the filmmaking in Invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice.
9846	-2.15789473684	A depressingly retrograde, 'post feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women.
9847	-1.42105263158	Return to Never Land is much more P.C. than the original version (no more racist portraits of Indians, for instance), but the excitement is missing.
9848	-1.63157894737	By the end, you just don't care whether that cold hearted snake Petrovich (that would be Reno) gets his comeuppance. Just bring on the Battle Bots, please!
9849	-0.947368421053	While it's all quite tasteful to look at, the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own.
9850	-2.73684210526	Broder's screenplay is shallow, offensive and redundant, with pitifully few real laughs.
9851	-1.05263157895	Yes they can swim, the title is merely Anne Sophie Birot's off handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through.
9852	-1.0	Don Michael Paul uses quick cuts, (very) large shadows and wide angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double (for Seagal).
9853	-0.157894736842	Slow, silly and unintentionally hilarious.
9854	-1.68421052632	The Sweetest Thing leaves a bitter taste.
9855	-2.52631578947	In a big corner office in Hell, Satan is throwing up his hands in surrender, is firing his R&amp;D people, and has decided he will just screen The Master of Disguise 24/7.
9856	-1.42105263158	For something as splendid looking as this particular film, the viewer expects something special but instead gets (sci fi) rehash.
9857	-1.68421052632	A thriller without a lot of thrills.
9858	-2.52631578947	This stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror.
9859	-1.47368421053	Ah, the travails of metropolitan life! Alas, another breathless movie about same!
9860	-0.210526315789	In Moonlight Mile, no one gets shut out of the hug cycle.
9861	-0.578947368421	Though uniformly well acted, especially by young Ballesta and Galan (a first time actor), writer/director Achero Manas's film is schematic and obvious.
9862	-1.57894736842	Done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment.
9863	-1.47368421053	Despite its visual virtuosity, 'Naqoyqatsi' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it.
9864	-3.15789473684	Slap her   she's not funny! No French people were harmed during the making of this movie, but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half.
9865	0.263157894737	Though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations, the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should.
9866	-1.47368421053	''One look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid?'' Um.....isn't that the basis for the entire plot?
9867	0.421052631579	''Not really as bad as you might think!''
9868	-1.36842105263	Strident and inelegant in its 'message movie' posturing.
9869	0.368421052632	One regards Reign of Fire with awe. What a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea.
9870	-0.947368421053	It has the right approach and the right opening premise, but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material.
9871	-1.13333333333	Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation, which is way too stagy.
9872	0.2	Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable, the director's experiment is a successful one.
9873	-0.2	The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish.
9874	-1.06666666667	I suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the DVD.
9875	-1.93333333333	An unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it.
9876	-1.8	Ninety minutes of Viva Castro! can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of Jesse Helms' anti  Castro rhetoric, which are included
9877	-2.26666666667	Comes off as a long, laborious whine, the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man.
9878	-1.46666666667	It just goes to show, an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller.
9879	-1.0	In a 102 minute film, Aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time. ... most viewers will wish there had been more of the ''Queen'' and less of the ''Damned.''
9880	-2.53333333333	Hopelessly inane, humorless and under inspired.
9881	-1.93333333333	Kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for (or worth rooting against, for that matter).
9882	-2.13333333333	It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy keen and so tub thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it.
9883	-1.26666666667	None of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of Bond, but much of it is good for a laugh. The problem with ''XXX'' is that its own action isn't very effective.
9884	-1.53333333333	A great script brought down by lousy direction. Same guy with both hats. Big mistake.
9885	-2.13333333333	A mediocre exercise in target demographics, unaware that it's the butt of its own joke.
9886	-1.26666666667	Director Kevin Bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the ''Miami Vice'' checklist of power boats, Latin music and dog tracks. He doesn't, however, deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash.
9887	-0.2	In gleefully, thumpingly hyperbolic terms, it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass, jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz.
9888	-0.4	The Spalding Gray equivalent of a teen gross out comedy.
9889	-1.33333333333	Perhaps even the SLC high command found writer director Mitch Davis's wall of kitsch hard going.
9890	0.133333333333	According to Wendigo, 'nature' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves.
9891	1.0	An encouraging effort from McCrudden
9892	-0.733333333333	The romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be.
9893	-2.46666666667	If I could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was, I would go back and choose to skip it. Fortunately, you still have that option.
9894	-1.73333333333	Supposedly authentic account of a historical event that's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment.
9895	0.0	Adroit but finally a trifle flat, Mad Love doesn't galvanize its outrage the way, say, Jane Campion might have done, but at least it possesses some.
9896	-1.53333333333	To Blandly Go Where We Went 8 Movies Ago ...
9897	-1.8	A slow moving police procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally.
9898	-1.46666666667	This u boat doesn't have a captain.
9899	-1.06666666667	With nary a glimmer of self knowledge, (Crane) becomes more specimen than character    and Auto Focus remains a chilly, clinical lab report.
9900	-2.6	This one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit.
9901	-1.90909090909	Dull, a road trip movie that's surprisingly short of both adventure and song.
9902	-2.36363636364	I walked away not really know who ''they'' were, what ''they'' looked like. Why ''they'' were here and what ''they'' wanted and quite honestly, I didn't care.
9903	-2.27272727273	After several scenes of this tacky nonsense, you'll be wistful for the testosterone charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions, especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal Mart budget.
9904	-2.31818181818	A relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd, contrived, overblown, and entirely implausible finale.
9905	-1.90909090909	The Country Bears wastes an exceptionally good idea. But the movie that doesn't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
9906	-2.63636363636	Adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like Pinocchio. As for children, they won't enjoy the movie at all.
9907	-2.63636363636	...you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for Frida to just die already.
9908	-2.0	Too bad writer director Adam Rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the Golden Eagle's carpets.
9909	-1.72727272727	It's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another.
9910	-1.22727272727	The movie is genial but never inspired, and little about it will stay with you.
9911	-1.54545454545	The movie obviously seeks to re create the excitement of such '50s flicks as Jules Verne's '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea' and the George Pal version of H.G. Wells' 'The Time Machine.' But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless.
9912	-1.36363636364	Despite the opulent lushness of every scene, the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings.
9913	-2.36363636364	even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other Bullock and Grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene. What should have been a painless time killer becomes instead a grating endurance test.
9914	-2.77272727273	A bland, obnoxious 88 minute infomercial for Universal Studios and its ancillary products.
9915	-2.54545454545	..little action, almost no suspense or believable tension, one dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci fi generic.
9916	-1.45454545455	The movie strains to stay on the light, comic side of the issue, despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and, potentially, of life itself.
9917	-3.40909090909	The Master of Disguise is awful. It's Pauly Shore awful. Don't say you weren't warned.
9918	-1.95454545455	Disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies...or any other John Woo flick for that matter.
9919	-1.09090909091	The entire movie is filled with deja vu moments.
9920	-1.31818181818	'Opening up' the play more has partly closed it down.
9921	-0.454545454545	What (Frei) gives us ... is a man who uses the damage of war    far more often than the warfare itself    to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows.
9922	-3.45454545455	An ugly, revolting movie.
9923	-2.31818181818	The film is way too full of itself; it's stuffy and pretentious in a give me an Oscar kind of way.
9924	-2.63636363636	The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn, and the nicest thing I can say is that I can't remember a single name responsible for it.
9925	-2.68181818182	Watching ''Ending'' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale. You can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff.
9926	-1.04545454545	Certainly beautiful to look at, but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic.
9927	-2.31818181818	It desperately wants to be a wacky, screwball comedy, but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time.
9928	-1.72727272727	The skills of a calculus major at M.I.T. are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long winded heist comedy Who Is Cletis Tout?
9929	-2.45454545455	From the choppy editing to the annoying score to 'special effects' by way of replacing objects in a character's hands below the camera line, ''Besotted'' is misbegotten
9930	-2.18181818182	My advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack.
9931	-1.44444444444	A film that presents an interesting, even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations.
9932	-2.05555555556	Filled with low brow humor, gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life.
9933	-2.27777777778	directed in a flashy, empty sub music video style by a director so self possessed he actually adds a period to his first name
9934	-2.11111111111	The 70 year old Godard has become, to judge from In Praise of Love, the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world at large without doing all that much to correct them.
9935	-2.0	An unsophisticated sci fi drama that takes itself all too seriously.
9936	-1.61111111111	Solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision, but that vision is beginning to feel, if not morally bankrupt, at least terribly monotonous.
9937	-1.11111111111	Harvard Man is a semi throwback, a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality.
9938	-1.66666666667	Supposedly based upon real, or at least soberly reported incidents, the film ends with a large human tragedy. Alas, getting there is not even half the interest.
9939	-0.888888888889	While Hoffman's performance is great, the subject matter goes nowhere.
9940	-0.722222222222	The smash 'em up, crash 'em up, shoot 'em up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense.
9941	-1.94444444444	Deuces Wild treads heavily into Romeo and Juliet/West Side Story territory, where it plainly has no business going.
9942	-1.44444444444	Hart's War seems to want to be a character study, but apparently can't quite decide which character.
9943	-2.44444444444	Theological matters aside, the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues.
9944	-2.16666666667	This latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff, demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent, well made B movie is long gone.
9945	-1.44444444444	Novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama.
9946	-1.88888888889	Been there, done that, liked it much better the first time around   when it was called The Professional.
9947	-1.88888888889	The film is all over the place, really. It dabbles all around, never gaining much momentum.
9948	-0.5	The beautiful, unusual music is this film's chief draw, but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep.
9949	-1.33333333333	The action quickly sinks into by the numbers territory.
9950	-2.77777777778	Forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention, giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining.
9951	-1.66666666667	When (Reno) lets her radical flag fly, taking angry potshots at George W. Bush, Henry Kissinger, Larry King, et al., Reno devolves into a laugh free lecture.
9952	-1.38888888889	Such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy, but Kaufman and Gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go.
9953	-2.5	Burns' fifth beer soaked film feels in almost every possible way    from the writing and direction to the soggy performances    tossed off.
9954	-0.944444444444	While this one gets off with a good natured warning, future Lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
9955	-2.5	Another boorish movie from the I heard a joke  at a frat party school of screenwriting.
9956	-1.88888888889	Too much of the movie feels contrived, as if the filmmakers were worried the story wouldn't work without all those gimmicks.
9957	-3.0	It's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie. And it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it.
9958	-1.38888888889	The ethos of the Chelsea Hotel may shape Hawke's artistic aspirations, but he hasn't yet coordinated his own DV poetry with the Beat he hears in his soul.
9959	-1.05555555556	The sight of the name Bruce Willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture, but the film has a lot more on its mind  maybe too much.
9960	-2.61111111111	Why sit through a crummy, wannabe hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies, when you could just rent those movies instead, let alone seek out a respectable new one?
9961	-2.46666666667	The obnoxious special effects, the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant, so five minutes ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy, dopey old Hanna Barbera charm.
9962	-1.73333333333	Exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film    but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as Kerrigan's platinum blonde hair.
9963	-1.8	The movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality. It doesn't really know or care about the characters, and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events.
9964	-1.86666666667	All mood and no movie.
9965	-2.93333333333	Press the delete key.
9966	-1.0	Simone is not a bad film. It just doesn't have anything really interesting to say.
9967	-0.933333333333	Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy, the film becomes predictably conventional.
9968	-1.26666666667	...hopefully it'll be at the dollar theatres by the time Christmas rolls around. Wait to see it then.
9969	-3.33333333333	There's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer. Or for the year, for that matter.
9970	-2.06666666667	Lacks the spirit of the previous two, and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck.
9971	-1.73333333333	This hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on Hopkins' inclination to play Hannibal Lecter again, even though Harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book.
9972	-2.0	Death to Smoochy tells a moldy oldie, not nearly  as nasty  as it  thinks it is joke. Over and over again.
9973	-2.4	The threat implied in the title Pokémon 4ever is terrifying – like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming.
9974	-1.53333333333	The film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements, in terms of love, age, gender, race, and class.
9975	-2.93333333333	To call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it.
9976	-2.06666666667	Entertainment more disposable than Hanna Barbera's half hour cartoons ever were.
9977	-1.8	The film falls short on tension, eloquence, spiritual challenge    things that have made the original New Testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries.
9978	0.133333333333	By the end of it all I sort of loved the people onscreen, even though I could not stand them. Perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter. It's not an easy one to review.
9979	-1.33333333333	At best this is a film for the under 7 crowd. But it would be better to wait for the video. And a very rainy day.
9980	-1.46666666667	The whole talking animal thing is grisly.
9981	0.666666666667	Never Again, while nothing special, is pleasant, diverting and modest    definitely a step in the right direction.
9982	-1.66666666667	Wouldn't it be funny if a bunch of Allied soldiers went undercover as women in a German factory during World War II? Um, no. But here's a movie about it anyway.
9983	-1.6	Has not so much been written as assembled, Frankenstein like, out of other, marginally better shoot em ups.
9984	-2.0	The punch lines that miss, unfortunately, outnumber the hits by three to one. But Death to Smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end.
9985	-1.53333333333	Mushes the college friends genre (The Big Chill) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas.
9986	-0.8	Showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment. Those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves. But ticket buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as Mr. De Niro.
9987	-1.66666666667	A determined, ennui hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird.
9988	0.533333333333	Too daft by half ... but supremely good natured.
9989	-2.0	Fails in making this character understandable, in getting under her skin, in exploring motivation...Well before the end, the film grows as dull as its characters, about whose fate it is hard to care.
9990	-1.66666666667	It's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow.
9991	-1.40740740741	Woody, what happened?
9992	-0.333333333333	Juliette Binoche's Sand is vivacious, but it's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th century prose behind her childlike smile.
9993	-1.96296296296	It's supposed to be post feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on Oprah.
9994	-1.77777777778	You can tell almost immediately that Welcome to Collinwood isn't going to jell.
9995	-2.18518518519	Throughout all the tumult, a question comes to mind: So why is this so boring?
9996	-1.59259259259	Cattaneo reworks the formula that made The Full Monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work.
9997	-1.33333333333	Routine and rather silly.
9998	-1.92592592593	A rip off twice removed, modeled after (Seagal's) earlier copycat Under Siege, sometimes referred to as Die Hard on a boat.
9999	-2.48148148148	Totally overwrought, deeply biased, and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are The Greatest Musicians of All Time.
10000	-2.81481481481	You can practically hear George Orwell turning over.
10001	-0.777777777778	Behan's memoir is great material for a film    rowdy, brawny and lyrical in the best Irish sense    but Sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance.
10002	-0.962962962963	While Holm is terrific as both men and Hjejle quite appealing, the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise.
10003	-1.85185185185	Lazy filmmaking, with the director taking a hands off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling.
10004	-2.85185185185	If it were any more of a turkey, it would gobble in Dolby Digital stereo. If nothing else, ''Rollerball'' 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by LL Cool J.
10005	-1.92592592593	A movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire.
10006	-2.18518518519	How do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any? On the evidence before us, the answer is clear: Not easily and, in the end, not well enough.
10007	-2.92592592593	The film's trailer also looked like crap, so crap is what I was expecting.
10008	-1.55555555556	More trifle than triumph.
10009	-2.22222222222	The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense, surprise and consistent emotional conviction.
10010	-3.22222222222	Festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you.
10011	-2.44444444444	Lyne's latest, the erotic thriller Unfaithful, further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded.
10012	-1.48148148148	It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss, and that's more or less how it plays out.
10013	-1.85185185185	Rumor, a muddled drama about coming to terms with death, feels impersonal, almost generic.
10014	-2.37037037037	Report card: Doesn't live up to the exalted tagline   there's definite room for improvement. Doesn't deserve a passing grade (even on a curve).
10015	-2.14814814815	The pacing is deadly, the narration helps little and Naipaul, a juicy writer, is negated.
10016	-2.81481481481	As his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in Long Time Dead says 'I'm telling you, this is f***ed'. Maybe he was reading the minds of the audience.
10017	-1.62962962963	...if it had been only half an hour long or a TV special, the humor would have been fast and furious   at ninety minutes, it drags.
10018	-1.81481481481	Bean drops the ball too many times... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay.
10019	-0.444444444444	A well acted, but one note film.
10020	-1.88888888889	Blood Work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from Eastwood's Dirty Harry period.
10021	-1.85714285714	The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications.
10022	-2.75	(Lee) treats his audience the same way that Jim Brown treats his women    as dumb, credulous, unassuming, subordinate subjects. And Lee seems just as expectant of an adoring, wide smiling reception.
10023	-3.25	There's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue.
10024	-2.60714285714	No amount of burning, blasting, stabbing, and shooting can hide a weak script.
10025	-2.0	It's an odd show, pregnant with moods, stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise.
10026	-2.39285714286	Nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here.
10027	-1.82142857143	The Armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment.
10028	-1.46428571429	Earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner.
10029	-1.67857142857	Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork: an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley's source novel (About Schmidt) and an old Payne screenplay.
10030	-2.17857142857	The exploitative, clumsily staged violence overshadows everything, including most of the actors.
10031	-2.60714285714	We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed 'Chris Rock,' 'Anthony Hopkins' and 'terrorists' into some Univac like script machine.
10032	-1.71428571429	Even when Crush departs from the 4W formula ... it feels like a glossy rehash.
10033	-1.53571428571	More likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat.
10034	-3.57142857143	Bears is even worse than I imagined a movie ever could be.
10035	-2.60714285714	When you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie, you know the picture is in trouble.
10036	-1.5	This is very much of a mixed bag, with enough negatives to outweigh the positives.
10037	-2.03571428571	Marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue.
10038	-3.21428571429	Whether it's the worst movie of 2002, I can't say for sure: Memories of Rollerball have faded, and I skipped Country Bears. But this new jangle of noise, mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title.
10039	-2.28571428571	(A) boldly stroked, luridly coloured, uni dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain.
10040	-1.32142857143	Not once in the rush to save the day did I become very involved in the proceedings; to me, it was just a matter of 'eh.'
10041	-3.53571428571	Rollerball IS as bad as you think, and worse than you can imagine.
10042	-2.71428571429	The first question to ask about Bad Company is why Anthony Hopkins is in it. We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce, because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low.
10043	-2.57142857143	Not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross out flicks, college flicks, or even flicks in general. It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them.
10044	-2.32142857143	Shame on writer/director Vicente Aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens, obsessive relationships, and rampant adultery so dull.
10045	-2.03571428571	Suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling.
10046	-1.03571428571	Violent, vulgar and forgettably entertaining.
10047	-2.0	Nothing happens, and it happens to flat characters.
10048	-1.89285714286	With a completely predictable plot, you'll swear that you've seen it all before, even if you've never come within a mile of The Longest Yard.
10049	-2.53571428571	Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled? When the twist endings were actually surprising? When the violence actually shocked? When the heroes were actually under 40? Sadly, as Blood Work proves, that was a long, long time ago.
10050	-1.60714285714	Blue Crush has all the trappings of an energetic, extreme sports adventure, but ends up more of a creaky ''Pretty Woman'' retread, with the emphasis on self empowering schmaltz and big wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought.
10051	-3.08695652174	This movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in Retard 101.
10052	-3.34782608696	What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie. In other words, it's badder than bad.
10053	-2.39130434783	If they broke out into elaborate choreography, singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention, but as it stands I kept looking for the last exit from Brooklyn.
10054	-1.82608695652	A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom of the bill fare like The Ghost and Mr. Chicken.
10055	-2.08695652174	A small independent film suffering from a severe case of Hollywood itis.
10056	-1.21739130435	Where the film falters is in its tone.
10057	-2.34782608696	The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head.
10058	-1.69565217391	Ultimately, Sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic, and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness.
10059	-1.4347826087	It's supposed to be a humorous, all too human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness    and strength    but it never quite adds up.
10060	-2.26086956522	Feels more like a rejected X Files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real life happening.
10061	-2.34782608696	Some motion pictures portray ultimate passion; others create ultimate thrills. Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance    it's the sci fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle Ball epic.
10062	-1.82608695652	An enigmatic film that's too clever for its own good, it's a conundrum not worth solving.
10063	-3.30434782609	A zombie movie in every sense of the word  mindless, lifeless, meandering, loud, painful, obnoxious.
10064	-1.60869565217	A film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted.
10065	-1.73913043478	It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie, and a sappy, preachy one at that.
10066	-0.782608695652	Definitely a crowd pleaser, but then, so was the Roman Colosseum.
10067	-0.434782608696	Certainly not a good movie, but it wasn't horrible either.
10068	-1.91304347826	Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming, it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful.
10069	-1.82608695652	The result is so tame that even slightly wised up kids would quickly change the channel.
10070	-2.34782608696	It appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge of the nerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up.
10071	-2.13043478261	Nothing but an episode of Smackdown! in period costume and with a bigger budget.
10072	-0.391304347826	It takes you somewhere you're not likely to have seen before, but beneath the exotic surface (and exotic dancing) it's surprisingly old fashioned.
10073	-2.21739130435	While the story is better focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it's based upon, Queen Of The Damned is a pointless, meandering celebration of the goth vampire, tortured woe is me lifestyle.
10074	-2.04347826087	It should be interesting, it should be poignant, it turns out to be affected and boring.
10075	-1.78260869565	A good looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance.
10076	-3.17391304348	A tired, predictable, bordering on offensive, waste of time, money and celluloid.
10077	-1.95652173913	If Hill isn't quite his generation's Don Siegel (or Robert Aldrich), it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair; it's all bluster and cliché.
10078	-2.52173913043	Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet, swipe 90 minutes of your time, and offer you precisely this in recompense: A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious.
10079	-2.60869565217	This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors.
10080	-1.08695652174	Does anyone much think the central story of Brendan Behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink?
10081	-2.25	`Martin Lawrence Live' is so self pitying, I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show.
10082	-2.08333333333	The dialogue is cumbersome, the simpering soundtrack and editing more so.
10083	-1.45833333333	Never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy, drama, melodrama or some combination of the three.
10084	-1.95833333333	It has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past.
10085	-2.29166666667	Does what should seem impossible: it makes serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer boring.
10086	-2.54166666667	Don't hate El Crimen del Padre Amaro because it's anti Catholic. Hate it because it's lousy.
10087	-1.875	... better described as a ghost story gone badly awry.
10088	-2.04166666667	Like a bad improvisation exercise, the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives, loves and the art they're struggling to create.
10089	-1.58333333333	The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end, they mock the kind of folks they don't understand, ones they figure the power lunchers don't care to understand, either.
10090	0.0416666666667	Competently directed but terminally cute drama.
10091	-1.29166666667	The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing.
10092	-3.79166666667	Not just unlikable. Disturbing. Disgusting. Without any redeeming value whatsoever.
10093	-3.45833333333	This thing is virtually unwatchable.
10094	-0.666666666667	Those eternally devoted to the insanity of Black will have an intermittently good time. Feel free to go get popcorn whenever he's not onscreen.
10095	-0.833333333333	The self serious Equilibrium makes its point too well; a movie, like life, isn't much fun without the highs and lows.
10096	-1.91666666667	The work of an exhausted, desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way.
10097	-1.95833333333	The main characters are simply named The Husband, The Wife and The Kidnapper, emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort.
10098	-2.16666666667	In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused.
10099	-1.33333333333	Swims in mediocrity, sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then.
10100	-1.29166666667	The only type of lives this glossy comedy drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies.
10101	-1.83333333333	The characters ... are paper thin, and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script.
10102	-1.375	A Sha Na Na sketch punctuated with graphic violence.
10103	-1.625	The trouble is, its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through.
10104	-1.16666666667	Spy vs. spy action flick with Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu never comes together.
10105	-1.41666666667	A so so, made for TV something posing as a real movie.
10106	-1.79166666667	The only upside to all of this unpleasantness is, given its Labor Day weekend upload, FearDotCom should log a minimal number of hits.
10107	-1.91666666667	Whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art, it's an unhappy situation all around.
10108	-1.41666666667	An uneasy mix of run of the mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection.
10109	-0.625	A formula family tearjerker told with a heavy Irish brogue...accentuating, rather than muting, the plot's saccharine thrust.
10110	-2.125	This is Sandler running on empty, repeating what he's already done way too often.
10111	-2.10526315789	This is as lax and limp a comedy as I've seen in a while, a meander through worn out material.
10112	-2.26315789474	Time literally stops on a dime in the tries so hard to be cool ''Clockstoppers,'' but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie going life.
10113	-0.473684210526	The sort of picture in which, whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do, they go to a picture perfect beach during sunset.
10114	-1.10526315789	Aptly named, this shimmering, beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me.
10115	-1.47368421053	A preposterously melodramatic paean to gang member teens in Brooklyn circa 1958.
10116	-1.42105263158	Has none of the crackle of ''Fatal Attraction'', ''9 ½ Weeks'', or even ''Indecent Proposal'', and feels more like Lyne's stolid remake of ''Lolita''.
10117	-1.36842105263	Everything its title implies, a standard issue crime drama spat out from the Tinseltown assembly line.
10118	-0.368421052632	An extraordinarily silly thriller.
10119	-1.63157894737	A rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade.
10120	-2.47368421053	Gaping plot holes sink this 'sub' standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth.
10121	-1.31578947368	Talkiness isn't necessarily bad, but the dialogue frequently misses the mark.
10122	-1.52631578947	The beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of (Godard's) vision, any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self righteousness of his voice.
10123	1.63157894737	The stunt work is top notch; the dialogue and drama often food spittingly funny.
10124	-2.10526315789	The movie isn't painfully bad, something to be 'fully experienced'; it's just tediously bad, something to be fully forgotten.
10125	-1.73684210526	Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions.
10126	-2.52631578947	What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted.
10127	-2.05263157895	No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story.
10128	-1.31578947368	The film ... presents classic moral condundrum drama: What would you have done to survive? The problem with the film is whether these ambitions, laudable in themselves, justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II Birkenau.
10129	-1.68421052632	... for all its social and political potential, State Property doesn't end up being very inspiring or insightful.
10130	-1.94736842105	A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time, and this isn't.
10131	-1.36842105263	Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true, but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable.
10132	-2.10526315789	The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome, with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper thin characterizations and facile situations.
10133	-3.15789473684	This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking: joyless, idiotic, annoying, heavy handed, visually atrocious, and often downright creepy.
10134	-2.10526315789	This off putting French romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of Amélie.
10135	-2.21052631579	overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
10136	-1.57894736842	Ensemble movies, like soap operas, depend on empathy. If there ain't none, you have a problem.
10137	-2.0	The Master of Disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on Saturday Night Live.'
10138	-1.84210526316	Yet another self consciously overwritten story about a rag tag bunch of would be characters that team up for a can't miss heist    only to have it all go wrong.
10139	-1.73684210526	Koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own.
10140	-1.84210526316	Is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets?
10141	-0.181818181818	More successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex, dramatically satisfying heroine
10142	-2.54545454545	Clumsy, obvious, preposterous, the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades.
10143	-2.31818181818	It's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip gloss. Rather, pity anyone who sees this mishmash.
10144	-2.95454545455	A banal, virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy.
10145	-1.5	The drama discloses almost nothing.
10146	-1.09090909091	A minor league soccer remake of The Longest Yard.
10147	-2.18181818182	Belongs in the too hot for TV direct to video/DVD category, and this is why I have given it a one star rating.
10148	-0.954545454545	As earnest as a community college advertisement, American Chai is enough to make you put away the guitar, sell the amp, and apply to medical school.
10149	-2.13636363636	A dim witted and lazy spin off of the Animal Planet documentary series, Crocodile Hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring.
10150	-1.95454545455	There is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down. And that should tell you everything you need to know about All the Queen's Men.
10151	-2.18181818182	Even fans of Ismail Merchant's work, I suspect, would have a hard time sitting through this one.
10152	-1.90909090909	It's really just another silly Hollywood action film, one among a multitude of simple minded, yahoo ing death shows.
10153	-0.590909090909	It's not a particularly good film, but neither is it a monsterous one.
10154	-1.40909090909	The world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like Martin Scorsese. But it doesn't need Gangs of New York.
10155	-0.545454545455	Enchanted with low life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts ... What is sorely missing, however, is the edge of wild, lunatic invention that we associate with Cage's best acting.
10156	-0.0909090909091	Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is deja vu all over again, and while that is a cliche, nothing could be more appropriate. It's likely that whatever you thought of the first production    pro or con    you'll likely think of this one.
10157	-1.77272727273	Sade achieves the near impossible: It turns the Marquis de Sade into a dullard.
10158	-1.90909090909	(Lin Chung's) voice is rather unexceptional, even irritating (at least to this Western ear), making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters.
10159	-2.54545454545	One of the most plain, unimaginative romantic comedies I've ever seen.
10160	-1.40909090909	Though there's a clarity of purpose and even handedness to the film's direction, the drama feels rigged and sluggish.
10161	-1.90909090909	Unfortunately, the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making.
10162	-2.40909090909	Unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction, Impostor is opening today at a theater near you.
10163	-1.77272727273	It should be doing a lot of things, but doesn't.
10164	-1.22727272727	Chen films the resolutely downbeat Smokers Only with every indulgent, indie trick in the book.
10165	-1.5	...a rather bland affair.
10166	-2.18181818182	Far fetched premise, convoluted plot, and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love.
10167	-1.54545454545	The movie tries to be ethereal, but ends up seeming goofy.
10168	-1.36363636364	I was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun, but it was neither.
10169	-1.77272727273	Harris is supposed to be the star of the story, but comes across as pretty dull and wooden.
10170	-3.09090909091	Soulless and    even more damning    virtually joyless, XXX achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence.
10171	-2.25925925926	A boring masquerade ball where normally good actors, even Kingsley, are made to look bad.
10172	-2.96296296296	All the Queen's Men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels, it should pay reparations to viewers.
10173	-1.96296296296	The filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart.
10174	-0.925925925926	Rather than real figures, Elling and Kjell Bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf's encounter with the world.
10175	0.222222222222	Mariah Carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in Glitter here in Wisegirls.
10176	-0.814814814815	It's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that, have at it.
10177	-2.51851851852	I suspect that you'll be as bored watching Morvern Callar as the characters are in it. If you go, pack your knitting needles.
10178	-2.51851851852	The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma. We don't even like their characters.
10179	-2.48148148148	Some writer dude, I think his name was, uh, Michael Zaidan, was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something, but, dude, the only thing that I ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck.
10180	-2.07407407407	The movie doesn't generate a lot of energy. It is dark, brooding and slow, and takes its central idea way too seriously.
10181	-3.2962962963	This feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
10182	-2.62962962963	Spectators will indeed sit open mouthed before the screen, not screaming but yawning.
10183	-1.81481481481	It feels like very light Errol Morris, focusing on eccentricity but failing, ultimately, to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs.
10184	-2.66666666667	A period story about a Catholic boy who tries to help a Jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell.
10185	-2.92592592593	The premise itself is just SOOOOO tired. Pair that with really poor comedic writing...and you've got a huge mess.
10186	-1.25925925926	Proves a lovely trifle that, unfortunately, is a little too in love with its own cuteness.
10187	-1.44444444444	Did we really need a remake of ''Charade?''
10188	-2.7037037037	Some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes: a setup, delivery and payoff. Stealing Harvard can't even do that much. Each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth.
10189	-2.14814814815	The only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game. You try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored.
10190	-1.7037037037	I spied with my little eye...a mediocre collection of cookie cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
10191	-1.92592592593	Entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics, but through the perverse pleasure of watching Disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel.
10192	-1.33333333333	The satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying.
10193	-1.81481481481	Less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is.
10194	0.185185185185	an ''O Bruin, Where Art Thou?'' style cross country adventure... it has sporadic bursts of liveliness, some so so slapstick and a few ear pleasing songs on its soundtrack.
10195	-1.66666666667	A feeble Tootsie knockoff.
10196	-2.81481481481	An awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers.
10197	-3.0	...the story is far flung, illogical, and plain stupid.
10198	-1.81481481481	The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary.
10199	-1.22222222222	An allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals African American professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing, but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message.
10200	-1.07407407407	A very familiar tale, one that's been told by countless filmmakers about Italian , Chinese , Irish , Latin , Indian , Russian  and other hyphenate American young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages.
10201	-1.0	One key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out.
10202	-0.4375	Essentially, the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
10203	-1.6875	A relentless, bombastic and ultimately empty World War II action flick.
10204	-2.8125	(Hell is) looking down at your watch and realizing Serving Sara isn't even halfway through.
10205	-2.4375	Too long, and larded with exposition, this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community.
10206	-1.375	Leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances.
10207	-0.375	...a ho hum affair, always watchable yet hardly memorable.
10208	-2.125	Swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough hewn vanity project for lead actress Andie MacDowell.
10209	-1.8125	The histrionic muse still eludes Madonna and, playing a charmless witch, she is merely a charmless witch.
10210	-2.3125	You have no affinity for most of the characters. Nothing about them is attractive. What they see in each other also is difficult to fathom.
10211	0.625	Diaz, Applegate, Blair and Posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert, if not amused.
10212	-1.0625	A technically well made suspenser...but its abrupt drop in IQ points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide.
10213	-1.6875	An inept, tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures, it contains almost enough chuckles for a three minute sketch, and no more.
10214	-2.375	It's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition.
10215	-2.25	Absolutely (and unintentionally) terrifying.
10216	-3.25	Eckstraordinarily lame and Severely boring.
10217	-2.0	Eight Legged Freaks falls flat as a spoof.
10218	-2.125	No matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus, accepting a 50 year old in the role is creepy in a Michael Jackson sort of way.
10219	-1.75	You'll just have your head in your hands wondering why Lee's character didn't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery.
10220	-1.875	'Dragonfly' dwells on crossing over mumbo jumbo, manipulative sentimentality, and sappy dialogue.
10221	-1.25	In his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter, Silberling also, to a certain extent, trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls.
10222	-0.9375	Blade II has a brilliant director and charismatic star, but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation.
10223	-1.625	Veers uncomfortably close to pro Serb propaganda.
10224	-1.75	Movies like High Crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation. How about surprising us by trying something new?
10225	-1.25	Final verdict: You've seen it all before.
10226	-1.5625	Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth, Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old World War II movie for overly familiar material.
10227	-1.1875	If A Few Good Men told us that we ''can't handle the truth'' than High Crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we ''don't care about the truth.''
10228	-2.4375	Further sad evidence that Tom Tykwer, director of the resonant and sense spinning Run Lola Run, has turned out to be a one trick pony    a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap.
10229	-2.5	You'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the Zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra large cotton candy.
10230	-1.4375	The movie is a little tired; maybe the original inspiration has run its course.
10231	-0.411764705882	This will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things.
10232	-2.35294117647	A full frontal attack on audience patience.
10233	-2.35294117647	Any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of God are framed in a drama so clumsy, there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that Bean abhors.
10234	-1.88235294118	It's a big idea, but the film itself is small and shriveled.
10235	-1.88235294118	Debut effort by ''Project Greenlight'' winner is sappy and amateurish.
10236	-2.58823529412	One gets the impression the creators of Don't Ask Don't Tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes. Too bad none of it is funny.
10237	-1.35294117647	The cast has a high time, but de Broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp.
10238	-1.47058823529	The film, like Jimmy's routines, could use a few good laughs.
10239	0.411764705882	The film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing, but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies.
10240	-1.17647058824	Purports to be a Hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging. Oh, and more entertaining, too.
10241	-2.88235294118	...in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes.
10242	-1.47058823529	Though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well acted by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal, I felt disrespected.
10243	-1.76470588235	Humor in I Spy is so anemic.
10244	-1.23529411765	The film is strictly routine.
10245	-1.47058823529	Skillful as he is, Mr. Shyamalan is undone by his pretensions.
10246	-0.705882352941	While the new film is much more eye catching than its blood drenched Stephen Norrington directed predecessor, the new script by the returning David S. Goyer is much sillier.
10247	-3.23529411765	In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history, Ballistic: Ecks Vs. Sever also features terrible, banal dialogue; convenient, hole ridden plotting; superficial characters and a rather dull, unimaginative car chase.
10248	-1.35294117647	It shares the first two films' loose jointed structure, but laugh out loud bits are few and far between.
10249	-1.82352941176	The Santa Clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids, but I've got to give it thumbs down.
10250	-3.17647058824	You cannot guess why the cast and crew didn't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed.
10251	-2.0	Barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull.
10252	-1.52941176471	If you're really renting this you're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices, you're interested in Anne Geddes, John Grisham, and Thomas Kincaid.
10253	-1.0	We get the comedy we settle for.
10254	-0.705882352941	The uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them.
10255	-1.47058823529	Two hours of sepia tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning.
10256	-2.0	A word of advice to the makers of The Singles Ward: Celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs. And neither do cliches, no matter how 'inside' they are.
10257	-1.47058823529	The campy results make Mel Brooks' Borscht Belt schtick look sophisticated.
10258	-1.82352941176	Its appeal will probably limited to LDS Church members and undemanding armchair tourists.
10259	-2.17647058824	The Hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork.
10260	-1.11764705882	Cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film.
10261	-2.54545454545	Manipulative claptrap, a period piece movie of the week, plain old blarney... take your pick. All three descriptions suit Evelyn, a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new.
10262	0.181818181818	Hey Arnold! is now stretched to barely feature length, with a little more attention paid to the animation. Still, the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett's story is appealing.
10263	-2.59090909091	True to its title, it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at.
10264	-2.04545454545	Doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago.
10265	-2.5	The plot is paper thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours.
10266	-1.95454545455	Kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious.
10267	-0.590909090909	The film didn't move me one way or the other, but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due.
10268	-1.81818181818	Queen of the Damned is too long with too little going on.
10269	-1.68181818182	It collapses when Mr. Taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller's rush.
10270	-2.0	Any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners, poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss.
10271	-1.59090909091	... Blade II is still top heavy with blazing guns, cheatfully filmed martial arts, disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves.
10272	-1.59090909091	The Rules of Attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing.
10273	-1.54545454545	Though there are many tense scenes in Trapped, they prove more distressing than suspenseful.
10274	-1.04545454545	In this film we at least see a study in contrasts; the wide range of one actor, and the limited range of a comedian.
10275	-1.72727272727	Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core.
10276	-1.72727272727	You have once again entered the bizarre realm where director Adrian Lyne holds sway, where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical, oddly abstract, and excruciatingly literal.
10277	-2.04545454545	The high concept scenario soon proves preposterous, the acting is robotically italicized, and truth in advertising hounds take note: There's very little hustling on view.
10278	-1.95454545455	This director's cut    which adds 51 minutes    takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera.
10279	-1.63636363636	Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle.
10280	-2.18181818182	the Venezuelans say things like ''si, pretty much'' and ''por favor, go home'' when talking to Americans. That's muy loco, but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of ''Dragonfly.''
10281	-2.90909090909	It's a movie that ends with Truckzilla, for cryin' out loud. If that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong, nothing will.
10282	-1.86363636364	Director Tom Shadyac and star Kevin Costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself.
10283	-3.22727272727	It's difficult to imagine that a more confused, less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002.
10284	-2.40909090909	Like the Tuck family themselves, this movie just goes on and on and on and on
10285	-2.04545454545	As pedestrian as they come.
10286	-1.31818181818	A film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen.
10287	-1.95454545455	It's a feel bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot button items in the viewer's face and asks to be seen as hip, winking social commentary.
10288	-0.409090909091	Put it somewhere between Sling Blade and South of Heaven, West of Hell in the pantheon of Billy Bob's body of work.
10289	-1.27272727273	More intellectually scary than dramatically involving.
10290	-2.31818181818	An inconsequential, barely there bit of piffle.
10291	-1.76470588235	The abiding impression, despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz, is of overwhelming waste    the acres of haute couture can't quite conceal that there's nothing resembling a spine here.
10292	-2.35294117647	As saccharine as it is disposable.
10293	-1.47058823529	You come away thinking not only that Kate isn't very bright, but that she hasn't been worth caring about and that maybe she, Janine and Molly    an all woman dysfunctional family    deserve one another.
10294	-0.882352941176	The metaphors are provocative, but too often, the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery.
10295	-2.11764705882	Very much a home video, and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all.
10296	-1.41176470588	Too much power, not enough puff.
10297	-1.76470588235	The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show.
10298	-0.823529411765	It's provocative stuff, but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill considered notion that Hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances.
10299	-1.05882352941	A cellophane pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains...Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential.
10300	-2.82352941176	Muddled, trashy and incompetent
10301	-1.70588235294	For this sort of thing to work, we need agile performers, but the proficient, dull Sorvino has no light touch, and Rodan is out of his league.
10302	-0.470588235294	Narc is all menace and atmosphere.
10303	-0.647058823529	Though excessively tiresome, The Uncertainty Principle, as verbally pretentious as the title may be, has its handful of redeeming features, as long as you discount its ability to bore.
10304	-1.17647058824	Despite Juliet Stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to Pamela's emotional roller coaster life, it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs.
10305	-1.82352941176	It's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing.
10306	-1.41176470588	his (Nelson's) screenplay needs some serious re working to show more of the dilemma, rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it.
10307	-1.82352941176	It's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through    despite some first rate performances by its lead.
10308	-1.52941176471	A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving.
10309	-2.17647058824	There are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them.
10310	-1.94117647059	As it stands, Crocodile Hunter has the hurried, badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla, which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction.
10311	-1.64705882353	The thing looks like a made for home video quickie.
10312	-0.941176470588	Enigma is well made, but it's just too dry and too placid.
10313	1.17647058824	''Sweet Home Alabama'' is what it is – a nice, harmless date film...
10314	2.94117647059	One of the best, most understated performances of (Jack Nicholson's) career.
10315	1.23529411765	The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' take on adolescence feels painfully true.
10316	3.47058823529	It's a masterpiece.
10317	0.764705882353	It may not be ''Last Tango in Paris'' but...
10318	1.52941176471	They crush each other under cars, throw each other out windows, electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness. And we don't avert our eyes for a moment.
10319	1.76470588235	Charming and funny (but ultimately silly) movie.
10320	2.58823529412	Third time's the charm...yeah, baby!
10321	1.05	A pleasant, if forgettable, romp of a film.
10322	2.4	By the end of the movie, you're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular.
10323	2.3	Birot creates a drama with such a well defined sense of place and age    as in, 15 years old    that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters.
10324	1.85	'Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall's intense freight train of a film.'
10325	1.5	The film delivers what it promises: A look at the ''wild ride'' that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops, cell phones and sketchy business plans.
10326	1.55	As a film director, LaBute continues to improve.
10327	1.85	Will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it.
10328	1.6	Catch it... if you can!
10329	0.4	Worse than 'Silence of the Lambs' better than 'Hannibal'
10330	0.45	American and European cinema has amassed a vast Holocaust literature, but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than The Grey Zone.
10331	0.95	'Possession,' based on the book by A.S. Byatt, demands that LaBute deal with the subject of love head on; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
10332	2.2	It's the kind of movie that, aside from Robert Altman, Spike Lee, the Coen Brothers and a few others, our moviemakers don't make often enough.
10333	1.95	Alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and isn't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience.
10334	1.8	The script is smart, not cloying.
10335	2.2	Visually, 'Santa Clause 2' is wondrously creative.
10336	2.0	A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception, which, while it may not rival the filmmaker's period pieces, is still very much worth seeing.
10337	2.75	One fantastic (and educational) documentary.
10338	1.8	An ambitious 'what if?' that works.
10339	1.65	''The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys'' has flaws, but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
10340	1.75	Nice piece of work.
10341	1.5	'Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall's intense freight train of a film.'
10342	1.45	It's funny, as the old saying goes, because it's true.
10343	1.45	Though the film is static, its writer director's heart is in the right place, his plea for democracy and civic action laudable.
10344	1.15	The filmmaker's heart is in the right place...
10345	1.25	From blushing to gushing   Imamura squirts the screen in `Warm Water Under a Red Bridge'
10346	2.7	Apart from anything else, this is one of the best sustained ideas I have ever seen on the screen.
10347	2.3	Not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral  and, hence, more chillingly effective.
10348	-3.55	Stupid, infantile, redundant, sloppy, over the top, and amateurish. Yep, it's ''Waking up in Reno.'' Go back to sleep.
10349	-2.85	I didn't laugh. I didn't smile. I survived.
10350	-3.75	The worst film of the year.
10351	-1.06666666667	In the book on tape market, the film of ''The Kid Stays in the Picture'' would be an abridged edition
10352	-1.8	A sour attempt at making a Farrelly Brothers style, down and dirty laugher for the female set.
10353	-1.6	Eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema's directorial giants.
10354	-1.53333333333	Taken as a whole, The Tuxedo doesn't add up to a whole lot.
10355	-1.2	This is no ''Waterboy!''
10356	-2.06666666667	Something has been lost in the translation...another routine Hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise.
10357	-1.8	The result is an 'action film' mired in stasis.
10358	-3.13333333333	...a movie that, quite simply, shouldn't have been made.
10359	-1.53333333333	By turns pretentious, fascinating, ludicrous, provocative and vainglorious.
10360	-0.533333333333	I can't recommend it. But it's surprisingly harmless.
10361	-1.4	What's next? The Porky's Revenge: Ultimate Edition?
10362	-2.66666666667	The script is a dim witted pairing of teen speak and animal gibberish.
10363	-0.266666666667	There's no real reason to see it, and no real reason not to.
10364	-2.8	Is ''Ballistic'' worth the price of admission? Absolutely not. It sucked. Would I see it again? Please see previous answer.
10365	-0.266666666667	It's exactly what you'd expect.
10366	-0.866666666667	''The Kid Stays in the Picture'' is a great story, terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this Cliff Notes edition is a cheat.
10367	-0.933333333333	A prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell.
10368	-1.66666666667	The movie is obviously a labour of love so Howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted.
10369	-2.26666666667	This isn't a movie; it's a symptom.
10370	-2.86666666667	What we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless, vapid and devoid of substance, in a movie that is definitely meaningless, vapid and devoid of substance.
10371	-1.26666666667	If only it were, well, funnier.
10372	-1.93333333333	The script? Please.
10373	-1.73333333333	Doesn't add up to much.
10374	-3.66666666667	One of the worst movies of the year.
10375	-3.66666666667	A complete waste of time.
10376	-3.2	Long before it's over, you'll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser.
10377	-3.73333333333	One of the worst movies of the year. ... Watching it was painful.
10378	-3.0	The cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious, untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate.
10379	3.06666666667	Spiderman ROCKS
10380	1.66666666667	A compelling coming of age drama about the arduous journey of a sensitive young girl through a series of foster homes and a fierce struggle to pull free from her dangerous and domineering mother's hold over her.
