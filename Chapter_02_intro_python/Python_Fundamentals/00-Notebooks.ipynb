    "\n",
    "According to [the official site](http://jupyter.org/), Project Jupyter is an open source project that allows you to share code in an interactive platform. JupyterLab is the next evolution from earlier Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter now supports many programming languages besides Python 2 and Python 3. See a list [here](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).\n",

    "### installing\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Jupyterlab, read the [documentation here](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io). The Jupyter docs recommend installing Anaconda; however, if you already have Python installed, just install jupyter with pip/pip3 commands. \n",

    "At terminal, in the folder of your choice, type **jupyter lab** and the server will start, and then open your default web browser to the local host URL. When you want to exit, save and close any notebooks you have open, close the browser tab, and hit ctrl-c a couple of times in the terminal window to shut down. \n",

To learn more about Markdown, click **Help** above, then **Markdown**.\n",
